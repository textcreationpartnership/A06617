            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough that the queſtion, to weet, whether it be lawfull for Chriſtians to make warres among themſelues, doth yet hang in controuerſie, not hauing at any time bin fully decided, becauſe it is hard to iudge in a difference, where the reaſons that either party alleadgeth for himſelfe, do make it ſo doubtfull, that hardly it may be reſolued: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding I dare beleeue that thoſe warres which are taken in hand neither for ambition, nor for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of reuenge, nor voluntarily, nor to the intent to vſurpe other mennes goods, are iuſt and lawfull; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially for a Prince, if it bee to defend his countrey and ſubiects, for whoſe ſafety he is bound to hazard his life. And in mine opinion it ſerueth to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that ſome alleadge out of the holy Scripture to the contrary, ſaying, that a good Chriſtian ought pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently to ſuffer the iniuries and wrongs that are done vnto him, without making reſiſtance vnto thoſe that would take away his goods, or would ſtrike him. For I hould opinion that that was only ſpoken vnto the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and their like, vnto whome it was neceſſary to haue humilitie and patience in all their buſines, if they would that the doctrine which they preached ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:10495:6"/>
bring foorth good fruite, and take roote, becauſe it was not in them to vſe force, and that in truth thoſe things which we perſwade with humilitie, are of much more vertue then thoſe things which are conſtrained to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued through violence. But as for vs which faithfully beleeue the Goſpell, and are not called to preach, and thoſe that do gouerne a people, I thinke it is lawfull for vs to vſe armes againſt them that would ouerrunne vs; and that the ſword was giuen vnto Princes to defend their Subiects and good men from the deuouring of the ſtronger and wicked: and conſequently, authoritie to helpe themſelues by armes, and through the force of their ſubiects, to make the royaltie which God hath giuen them to be of eſtimation; for it is not without cauſe that they do beare the ſword, nor without miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Wherfore in mine opinion, Princes may iuſtly take armes in hand for the defence of their ſubiects, and the ſubiects likewiſe for the maintenance of their Princes authoritie, and that to this intent it ſhould be lawfull to leuy men, and afterwards to make warres. Not that this taking vp of men ſhould be handled, after the manner of thoſe people which do enrowle themſelues voluntarily, and which go to the warres for a brauery; or to the intent to make a hand therby: but I meane, that this leuy ſhould be made by the commandement of the Prince, and that the ſubiects ſhould neither haue liberty to offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, nor refuſe to goe whither it ſhall be his good pleaſure to ſend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> within his countrey to driue out an enemy only, and not to aſſault him. As we ſee in <hi>Fraunce</hi> the King doth leuy his <hi>Rierban,</hi> and may compell them to goe into any of the frontiers of his countrey, for the defence of the ſame, in which caſe, there is no Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb facs="tcp:10495:6"/>
that may refuſe, or excuſe himſelfe; but muſt be there at the day appointed, if the excuſe be not very law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. So that me thinke, theſe <hi>Rierbans</hi> may then goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Kings enemies, and enter into battaile againſt them, without charge of conſcience any way; as well for that naturall reaſon would that euery man ſhould defend his goods and countrey: as alſo, becauſe it is the King that commaundeth vs to go, vnto whome we are bound by the lawes of God to obeye, and vnto all other Pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates hauing charge from him. The leuy then which is made in this order, and to this intent, is not (as I thinke) reprouable; and ſo likewiſe is to be thought of the ſeruice which the common people do vnto their Prince, which in my iudgement, is ſo reaſonable, that I dare affyrme, that thoſe that happen to be ſlaine in this quarrell; ſhall not be reproued for the ſame before God: which I will not ſay for thoſe that goe out of their Countrey to ſeeke their aduentures, what likelyhood of good title ſo euer they haue, for their excuſe can not be grounded vpon any coulor of reaſon that I do knowe. So it is then, that if the Prince do compell them to goe, they ſhall be mutch more excuſable, then when they go of their owne free wills, foraſmutch as we owe (as is aboue ſaid) all obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto our King; and who ſo reſiſteth the King, reſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the ordinance and will of God. Wherefore if we commit any fault in obeying him, that is to ſay, if we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his enemyes as farre-foorth as the lawes of armes will permit, and no further, we muſt thinke that the fault ſhall not be altogether ours, but that he ſhall haue his part in it; but peraduenture the gouernment may be handled ſo gratiouſly in moderating of our quarrels, that one of our warres may rather be called a threatning, or a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
<pb facs="tcp:10495:7"/>
then otherwiſe: becauſe it cannot well be tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a warre, for that the controuerſie, or quarrell, that thoſe that are of one party haue amongſt themſelues, is called a Mutinie, and wee are all belonging vnto one, to weet, vnto Chriſt. Therfore the controuerſies which we haue ſometimes amongſt vs, are very mutinies, and ought not properly to be called by any other name: in conſideration whereof, as often as we fall into this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience, we ought to vſe the matter in ſutch ſort, and with ſutch modeſtie, that from an outward ſedition, we fall not into a right cruell warres: and that we which do carry one name, and make profeſsion to preach per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect amitie, ſaying, that we all are one onely body in Chriſt, do not become deuided, wholy contrary vnto the ſignification of our name, and the ſufferance of our law. For in truth, in troubling one another as we do, our forces diminiſh, and the infidels waxe ſtronger, who knowe ſo well to make their profit of our ſaid mutinies, that they from day to day do enlarge their Empyre, and aſſure it to themſelues, while we fight together, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume one anothers forces for a thing of naught. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they vſe ſo great induſtrie, that it is to be feared that in time they will by little and little take from vs the reſt which we enioy. And yet there is none that doth looke into it, or if any do fore-ſee, none that do make ſhew to withſtand it, ſo that euery one truſteth vnto them that are the neareſt borderers, ſaying, let them defend if they will, and that it will be long eare they come vnto vs, but that is an opinion that may aſwell deceiue vs one day, as it hath done others that truſted therevnto, eſpecially thoſe that made no accompt to quench the fire that was kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at their owne dores, as hath been ſeene amongſt the
<pb facs="tcp:10495:7"/>
                     <hi>Greekes,</hi> who were ſlothfull to helpe one another, when the <hi>Turkes</hi> came firſt downe into <hi>Greece,</hi> at which time they were of ſmall force, but after that they had once put in their foote, it was then too hard to driue them out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and therefore they haue continued their maiſters, and the firſt inhabitants were forced to ſeeke other ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, or to abide their tyrannies. The <hi>Hungarians</hi> likewiſe looked to be intreated to ſend ayde againſt the ſame aduerſarie, and it is ſeene what they haue gotten thereby. The <hi>Polonians, Bohemians,</hi> and <hi>Almaigns,</hi> were long time negligent to ſuccour <hi>Hungary</hi> for their owne particular quarrels, and therefore the <hi>Turke</hi> is at theyr gates. <hi>Italy, Spayne,</hi> and <hi>Fraunce,</hi> haue ſuffered for to ſpite one another, that many ſtrong Townes, Ilands in the ſea, and Countreys, haue been loſt within this forty yeares vnto their great ſhame, for which they do alreadie ſuffer a certaine pennance, to weete, by the courſes and pillages that are made vpon their ſea coaſts, beſides the feare that each one of them hath to receiue a worſe turne, how long ſoeuer it be deferred. Truly it is againſt that vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing people that our Princes ſhould declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues enemies, for to keep out of their hands that which yet remaineth vnto vs, and to recouer from them that which they vniuſtly hold from the Chriſtians, for that for a more iuſt or holy quarrell, they cannot require to take armes in hand, and in truth ſutch a warre as would not offend God, ſith it ſhould be but to make reſiſtance vnto a people that do ſeeke to put downe our Religion, to aduance theirs, and our common wealth, to make themſelues lords and monarks of all. Suppoſe that our ſaid Princes ſhould do no other good, but deliuer the poore Chriſtians, which they do tirannouſly and outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geouſly
<pb facs="tcp:10495:8"/>
vſe at all times, and hinder, that little infants ſhould not from henceforth be taken out of the armes and laps of their fathers and mothers to be circumciſed as they are, and inſtructed in countryes vnto them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, in that moſt damnable ſect of <hi>Mahumet,</hi> their parents neuer hearing what is become of them; and which is worſe, of the members of Ieſus Chriſt, are made members of the Diuell; ſhould not this be ynough for our ſaid Princes? me thinke yea, and to their great honor, whereas it is to their great ſhame that they do no better indeuer. Well, I doubt that they ſhall one day yeld an accompt for it, and not only they; but alſo thoſe that haue any authority amongſt vs: principally my maiſters the prelates of the Church, who little regard to declare it vnto them, vnto whom it appertaineth; and furthermore to employ a good portion of their owne goods, ſeeing they haue wherewithal to do it, and very good occaſion to ſpeake of it. Notwithſtanding they are cold, and make no reckning (as is aboue ſaid) of the danger that they are in, nor of the ſeruitude that the poore Chriſtians which dwell in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> are held in, vnder the hands of Infidels, to the great preiudice of our Religion, for the which all faithfull Chriſtians ought to take armes in hand againſt our common aduerſary rather to day, then to morrow. And to that end I beleeue firmely, that it is lawfull for vs to make warres, if it be not lawfull for any other intent. Prouided alwayes, that the cauſe that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs therevnto be ſutch as it ought to be; and that the determination be not to kill thoſe that will not by and by beleeue. For it is not with the ſtroke of the ſword that Infidels are conuerted, and become Chriſtians; but it is example and conference that may do more then force:
<pb facs="tcp:10495:8"/>
and the force (I ſay) which we may do vnto them, is only that we ſhould defend our marches, or deliuer the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the aboueſaid Countryes, out of the captiuities that they are in: or if ſo be that the ſaid infidels would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter further vpon vs, or would not freely depart out of the countryes which they do vſurp, I am of opinion that we might goe vpon them for theſe cauſes, and make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a moſt cruell and ſharp warre; and yet notwithſtanding hauing the victory, vſe them as gently as we do vſe one another in our warres, foraſmutch as peraduenture they might heereafter be conuerted: and in truth no man was euer reproached for making of honeſt warres, and for ſhewing mercy vnto the vanquiſhed. This then is the moſt iuſt warres of all that a Chriſtian may make; the defence of our Prince and his Realme is the next. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a Prince may goe out of his Countrey to aſſault a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, ſo that it be to get his owne againe, if ſo be that it were taken wrongfully from him, or that any people his ſubiects did rebell: for ſith Princes haue charge of their ſubiects, and therefore may puniſh thoſe that do wrong one to another; who is it then that ſhall forbid them to aske theyr owne, and to recouer with force that which is kept from them by force? ſeeing that they haue no body to runne vnto greater then themſelues, or that is their ſuperior. I ſpeake of a king of <hi>Fraunce</hi> or of another his equall, ſpecially after hauing made the requeſts and demonſtrations vnto the withholders that in ſutch a caſe are neceſſary. In which caſe if it were not lawfull to haue recourſe vnto armes, it would therof enſue; that the world would be ſo ful of vprores, &amp; of thoſe that ſeke to ſurpriſe one another, chiefly the ſuttle ſort, being aſſured they ſhould not ſuffer ſmart for the violence they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit:
<pb facs="tcp:10495:9"/>
a thing not tollerable, becauſe the common peace would be too mutch diſquieted. I ſay further for the ſubiects, that if the King do compell them to enter vpon the lands of another man, vnder what title ſo euer it be, that they are not to enquire whether it be good or euill, nor are ſo culpable as ſo me perhaps will ſay that they are, ſo that they do it to obey him, for they ought to depend vpon him all in all. But as concerning the King who is the occaſion, it ſhall be his deede, and thoſe that counſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him therevnto. Then to play ſurely a Prince which pretendeth to make warres, ought to handle the matter ſo, that his pretences do not ſauour of any of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions aforeſaid, or elſe he cannot ſo well colour his fact, but that his cauſe would be wrongfull. And ſuppoſe further that he hath ſome colour to make warres, yet is it better, firſt before any thing be taken in hand, to haue recourſe vnto arbitrers, then to be the occaſion of the great miſchiefes which do follow a warre: but if ſo be that his aduerſary refuſed conference, or would not put his controuerſie to arbitrers that are not to be ſuſpected, and that it behoued him with all ſpeed to take armes for his refuge, and to inuade his ſaid aduerſarie, or thoſe that do him wrong, it ought to be done with a maxime, to make the leaſt outragious and bloudy warres that he might, and the ſhorteſt. In conſideration whereof, a Prince which at any time findeth himſelfe driuen vnto the neceſsitie to aſſault his neighbours, or to be aſſaulted himſelfe, ought betimes to furniſh himſelfe with good ſouldiours, which ſhould not only be valiant men, and well practiſed, but moreouer ſhould be men of good life, to the intent he might in ſhort time ouercome his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes, without too great a loſſe of his owne people, or of
<pb facs="tcp:10495:9"/>
his aduerſaties, but as the equitie of a gratious warre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth. But for that it would be impoſsible to conduct a warre of great importance ſoone to an end, without the hauing of very good Souldyers, and further to keepe them from endomaging himſelfe and others, except they were men of very good life, it ſhould be neceſſary that the ſaid Prince ſhould haue a care, that thoſe whome he pretendeth to employ in this buſines, ſhould be the leaſt vitious, and moſt expert in the feat of armes that he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly could finde. And that he ſhould ſeeke by all meanes poſsible to make them ſo perfect, which cannot be done without reading of the Authors that haue giuen rule for it, wherein I haue ſomewhat ſpent my time, becauſe I would gladly be the occaſion of ſome profit vnto the King if I might. And hauing ſeene and read the ſaid Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors ſufficiently, at leaſt the moſt renowned, I haue in fyne aſſayed to ſhew by this worke, how the ſaid Lord might recouer ſutch Souldyers as are ſpoken of, and to that ende I haue diſtributed this worke into three parts. The firſt ſhall ſhewe how to leuie a great number in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and how to traine them to haue ſeruice of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in euery place. The ſecond ſhall treate of all the points that a Captaine Generall ought to know how to conduct the warres to his honor, and to ouercome his enemies. The third ſhall alſo treate of the ſame matter, and ſhall like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſpeake of the lawes that ought to raigne amongſt Souldyers. Of all which things ſhal be ſo largely ſpoken, that peraduenture I ſhall be found too troubleſome vnto thoſe that ſhall ſee my worke, ſpecially for that I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to make ample mention of all that appertaineth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this ſcience, except it be how to defend a place. For I do preſuppoſe that the hoaſt which I will make, ſhall be
<pb facs="tcp:10495:10"/>
alwayes ſo ſtrong, that it ſhall not at any time be conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to encloſe itſelfe where it may be beſieged: but I meane to make it ſutch a one, that it may beſiege and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault al others. Which to do, throghout the whole book I haue choſen for my chiefe guide the vſes and cuſtoms which I do find haue bin obſerued of the auncient Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, after whoſe example I do gouerne my ſelfe more then after the manner that is now in vſe amongſt vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ours is too far differing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that <hi>Militarie diſcipline,</hi> which ought to be obſerued among vs for the better. And the reaſon that maketh me to beleeue that it is ſo contrary, and of mutch leſſe value then theirs, is, that all things concerning this matter were mutch better done by them, then they are by vs, and that their Souldiers were more orderly, more painefull, more vertuous, and better men of warre then we are, as the deedes both of the one and the other would make ſhew, who ſo would compare them together. Wherefore I would frame them of whome I intend to ſpeake, after the auncient manner, and according vnto my ſmall capacitie. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I follow the auncient manner in moſt part of the actions which a Campe doth, notwithſtanding it is without reiecting our owne faſhions in any thing that I thinke them to be ſurer then theirs. And if I put too any thing of mine owne, it is not without due examination, and that I know that there is ſome aduantage to be had in vſing the manner I do ſpeake of. If then mine opinion be thought anything worth, let it be taken in good part, for I haue done it for the deſire I haue to ſee our <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi> in better ſtate then it is at this day. But if ſo be it be found to be worth nothing, let it be then left wholly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe that I haue borrowed it of, and vnto me. And if
<pb facs="tcp:10495:10"/>
peraduenture the affayres of <hi>Fraunce</hi> do ſtand at any time in ill ſtate for want of foreſight (which God forbid) let the fault be layd vppon their necks, that might haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medyed it; if they had would, and not vppon his that would haue remedyed it, if he might.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He authours, which heretofore haue buſied themſelues to giue rules ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayning vnto the warres, would by their ſayings that thoſe men of whome a Prince would pretend to haue ſeruice, ſhould be leuied in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate countries, if ſo bee he would haue them to bée both valiant &amp; wiſe. For they ſay that hot countries doo bring foorth wiſe men, but they are cowards, and that cold coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries do bring foorth hardie men, but they are fooles. But I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that they haue left vs this counſaile only to ſerue the turne of ſome monarke, or puiſſant king, whoſe dominions do ſtretch ſo wide, that both theſe qualities may be found ſeperably in the countries that are vnder his hands, and hath power to leuie and chooſe his men in what part he will, as the auncient Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours did at that time when almoſt all the whole world was in their obedience. But to giue a rule that princes of meane power may helpe themſelues withall: although their countries be ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated in extreame hot or cold regions, I doo affirme that this conſideration ſhall nothing hinder ſuch a prince to ſerue himſelf with his ſubiects, but that he may make them hardie which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally are cowards, and thoſe wiſe which of themſelues are
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:10495:12"/>
fooles, for that wee may plainly ſee by old examples, that in all places, whether they be cold or hot, there may bee very good ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, ſo that there be exerciſe vſed and diligence: for that which by nature wanteth may be ſupplied by induſtrie and exerciſe, in this arte ſpecially which conſiſteth more in this poynt then in any other, by meanes whereof the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded long time ouer all <hi>Greece,</hi> the <hi>Thebans</hi> deliuered them from the obedience of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> reſtoring them vnto their former libertie: and the <hi>Romans</hi> (as ſaith <hi>Vegetius</hi>) ſurmounted through their exerciſe and diſcipline, the multitude of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> the pride of the <hi>Germaines;</hi> the force of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyards,</hi> the riches and warines of the <hi>Affricanes,</hi> and the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and ſubtilties of the <hi>Greekes;</hi> although they were infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours vnto the ſaid nations in all things, only except exerciſe, and ſkill to make warres. Furthermore, I ſay that if a Prince pretend at any time to preuaile, that he ought to leuie his men of warre amongſt his ſubiects, whether that his kingdome were ſcituated in the midſt of the frozen ſea, or in the midſt of <hi>Libia,</hi> which in mine opinion, are the two extreameſt hot and coldeſt climates that are: ſo that he would imploy a little diligence to faſhion them as appertaineth. Chiefly hauing occaſion to take vp men for to make warres, except he do take his own ſubiects, it will be doubtfull that he ſhall receiue a ſhrewd turne by them, for that ſtraungers can neuer ſerue a Prince ſo loyally, but that his owne ſubiects will ſerue him more faithfully then they, and with a better heart: becauſe the Princes quarrell that hath them in charge, is not a matter that toucheth one perticular bodie, nor a third, but it concerneth all thoſe that ſhall feele the ſmart of it for their Lord: foraſmuch as if he receiue any loſſe, of neceſſitie it muſt redound vnto the great loſſe of his ſubiects, becauſe they are the pray of the vanquiſher, if their Prince bée vanquiſhed. And on the contrary part, let them make themſelues all rich, and not ſtraungers, if their Prince be victorious. Beſides, the good name and reputation that they ſhall get, which is a poynt that ſometime maketh the greateſt coward hardie; &amp; the ſhame which is to be looked for if they léeſe is theirs alſo. For it will not be ſayd that the mercenaries haue loſt; but the nation of the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:10495:12"/>
Prince will bee named: as in the conflicts which the king hath had in his time, it hath not béen ſayd, that the Lanceknights, or the <hi>Switzers,</hi> or the <hi>Italians</hi> haue béen ouerthrowne: although there haue béen fewe others in our camps; but it hath béen ſayd that they were the Frenchmen, and notwithſtanding it may bée that there haue not béen thrée thouſand Frenchmen, whereas the ſtraungers haue béen fifteene, or twentie thouſand perſons. And if at any time we haue had the vpper hand of our enemies, the glorie hath not béen attributed ſo wholly vnto vs, but that euery one of the other nations haue looked to haue had their parts in it. And if perchaunce any man hath ſayd the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men haue had the victorie in ſuch a battell, it hath béen by and by caſt in his noſe, thanke ſuch and ſuch, and there is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it ſhould be ſo, ſéeing it is ſo that they haue done it. So much a do there is to kéepe our good name, as there were no better way then to let them alone, that from henceforth they ſhould neither be the occaſion of our winnings nor loſings: but that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man ſhould meddle with his owne quarrell, and that wee Frenchmen ſhould bee let alone to debate the controuerſies we haue with our neighbours, without intermingling other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which haue but a little care to dye for vs. And who make ſo little accompt of the matter as we ſee that they do, becauſe it toucheth them nothing, for all the thought that they haue, is to finde many occaſions to lengthen the warres, to the intent that they may alwaies bee ſet a worke. And for to be without them there is no order taken, becauſe of the little accompt that wee do make of our ſelues. I ſay then, that a Prince ought to ſerue him ſelfe with his owne ſubiects, for the reaſons before alleadged. And if we will be warned by things paſt, wee haue many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples before our eyes for this matter. As by Empyres which are come to ruine through this fault, (to weete) both that of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and alſo of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> For the Romane Empyre after it was mounted vnto the higheſt in the time of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> began to deſcend, when the Romane citizens were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected out of the hoaſts which the Emperous did make. And that they grounded themſelues vpon the force of mercenaries, and thoſe whom they before time had conquered. And although the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:10495:13"/>
great vertues and iudgement that were in the ſaid <hi>Caeſar,</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the maieſtie of the Empyre while he liued: yet is it ſo, that his ſucceſſors learning of him to wage other nations then Romans: as Frenchmen, Spanyards, Almaignes and others, haue béen the occaſion of the ruine of the ſame: for all the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours that were after <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> would keepe an hoaſt of ſtraungers hard vnder the walles of the citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was called the Pretorie, &amp; was ſuch as we would ſay the guard that kings haue for the aſſurance of their perſons: but this guard was of ten or twelue thouſand choſen men, much like vnto the Mammeluks of the Souldane, or the Ianiſſaries of the Turke: which manner although it ſeemed at the firſt ſight to haue been for the profit of the Empyre; notwithſtanding it tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it oftentimes vpſidowne: becauſe that this number of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers diſpoſed of that dignitie at their pleaſure, being vpon the place and in armes, againſt naked men and vnarmed. On the other ſide, the other armies which were in <hi>Fraunce, Barbarie,</hi> and elſwere, would ſtand in their owne conceipts, the one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming one to be Emperour, and the other another: inſomuch that ſometime there were two or three pretendants: who in thinking to conſume one another, conſumed the Empyre, which had coſt ſo much the getting: a thing that they were ignorant of. But after that, moſt of the Emperours were of ſtraunge nations, as the ſoldiers which had made them, were: it was an occaſion that they had leſſe care of the preſeruation of the Empyre: then if they had béen borne within the citie. Whereof inſued, that as well thoſe that were declared Emperours, as thoſe that had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected them, marched againſt the ſayd citie with one conſent as againſt their enemies, with intent to triumph ouer it. And God knowes whether that theſe things might be handled, without the committing of many robberies, &amp; inſolencies in thoſe chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and alſo of many murthers aſwell of the Emperours them ſelues, as of the Senators, &amp; other great perſonages in <hi>Rome.</hi> Certainly wee muſt ſay that it was impoſſible, ſeeing that wee may beleeue, that if the inſtitutions which the Romanes had at that time that their vertue floriſhed, had béen alwaies main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that was to make warre with their owne people, and not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:10495:13"/>
to haue waged ſtraungers, nor likewiſe to haue ſuffered their neighbours and alliance in their camps, in greater number then they themſelues were, their Empyre had not been deuided, nor had not béen tranſported out of their hands, nor their citie ſo many times deſtroyed, and abandoned as it hath béen. For if they had maintained their firſt manner of warre, they had eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped all their inconueniences, and had brought all their enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to as happie ende, as they did while they ſerued themſelues with their owne citizens. <hi>Michaell Paleologus</hi> the Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> may likewiſe be an example: who calling a number of Turkes to his aide to make warres againſt certaine princes of <hi>Greece</hi> that rebelled againſt him, ſhewed them the way to paſſe out of <hi>Aſia</hi> into <hi>Europe,</hi> and therevpon the ſaid Turkes tooke occaſion to come vpon <hi>Greece</hi> with great force, and to inuade it by little and little. Of which miſchiefe the ſayd Emperour was cauſe, for that he choſe rather to cauſe ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to come to his aſſiſtance, then to take vp in his countrie thoſe that were neceſſarie for him to make his warres withall, with whom, if he had would, he might with little labour haue vanquiſhed a Lord of <hi>Bulgarie,</hi> his ſubiect, and haue chaſtened him without thruſting an armie of Turkes into his countrie, who if they had not come there, <hi>Greece</hi> had not ſuffered the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries which it hath ſuffered in time paſt, and which it muſt yet euery day ſuffer. And therefore without hauing regard vnto the old opinion, that is to ſay: whether the countrie be cold or hot, and to withſtand the manifold inconueniences that may happen vnto thoſe that may make their warres with the helpe of ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, me thinke that euery Prince ought to ſtrengthen himſelfe with his ſubiects, without making any accompt to hyer others: or at the leaſt if he would be ſerued with ſtrangers, not to make them his principall force, for the daunger that might happen. As for to commit the perſon of a king, or of the greateſt perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of a kingdome, vnto the truſt of thoſe that are not his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and who loue him not, and the ſeruice which they do him is but for a few crownes: is a counſaile grounded vpon no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe it is to bee thought that ſtraungers are much more eaſie to bee corrupted, then thoſe that are borne and bred in the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:10495:14"/>
ſame countrie that their king is. The preſeruation of whom, ought to bee more deare vnto them, then vnto thoſe that ſerue him but for his monie: which once failing, they abandon him as if they had neuer knowne him. Herevpon I may alleadge that which a great troope of Launceknights did vnto <hi>Monſiure Montpenſier</hi> in <hi>Naples:</hi> who left him there at the mercie of the Spanyards, only becauſe his monie failed, and that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies promiſed them payment at their firſt arriuall and aſſoone as they were turned from that parte, which was cauſe of the loſſe of the ſame kingdome the firſt time. And not to accuſe the Almaignes only, I ſay that the Switzers left <hi>Monſiure de latrec</hi> at that time that the terme of their payment was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired: becauſe they doubted that they ſhould haue borrowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the moneth following. And although that the ſayd Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers did not go from vs vnto our enemies: yet euery man kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth well that they forſooke the ſayd Lord when as his enemies were equall vnto him in ſtrength, which was cauſe of the loſſe of the Dutchie of <hi>Millain.</hi> Since that the Griſons departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our campe before <hi>Pauie,</hi> and abandoned the King his perſon, euen at that inſtant that the Spanyards were determined to hazard the battell, and to aſſault him, which happened within few daies after; ſo that the going away of thoſe bands did great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weaken our armie (for they were ſixe or eight thouſand) and was cauſe that the enemie did enterpriſe more boldly to aſſault vs, and that our men were more diſcouraged to receiue them, in ſo much that putting thereunto the euil behauiour of our Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers, who went away without ſtriking ſtroke we loſt the battel. Whereby appeareth plainly, the little truſt that is to bée giuen vnto ſtraungers: and how daungerous it is for vs to repoſe our ſtate in their forces. Whoſoeuer he were, I wil not be of opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that a King ſhould make his force of ſtraungers, nor that he ſhould entertaine ſo many, that they ſhould bee of equall force with his owne ſubiects, if it were ſo that he were conſtrained to take any. For if the ſtraungers be as ſtrong as his owne people, and that it were neceſſarie that the ſayd ſtraungers ſhould doe any thing that were contrarie vnto their mindes, which they refuſed, they muſt bee fought withall, or there will bee no obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:10495:14"/>
but if they finde themſelues the weaker, they will neuer haue the heart to diſobey nor to buſie themſelues with the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of a Captaine Generall, as they are when there is no meane to bridle them. For which cauſe a Prince that might find himſelfe in extremitie, not to be obeyed of the ſtraungers which he might retaine, ought to haue in his campe ſuch a number of his owne ſubiects, that if he were driuen to vſe force, they might be of power ſufficient to conſtraine the rebels to accompliſh his will. For otherwiſe there will be nothing done, becauſe the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the ſayd Prince will be ſlacked, and ſometime a diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience may be cauſe of many great domages, as was that of the Almaignes which <hi>Monſiure de Humiers</hi> had with them in <hi>Italie,</hi> which made the King not only to looſe all that ſeaſon, but alſo was cauſe of the loſſe of diuers places that held for vs, and put all <hi>Piemount</hi> in great daunger to be loſt without recouerie. And this is moſt certaine, inſomuch that if the Lord Conſtable had any whit deferred to ſuccour them, and had not vſed his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed diligence, that which was left had fallen in fewe daies after into the Spanyards hands, without ſtriking ſtroke. Yet he arriued ſo luckely, that the townes that had but the newes of his comming were preſerued, and part of thoſe that were loſt were recouered, and others alſo, but not without a merueilous charge: and all to repayre the fault of the foreſayd Almaignes, who had conducted the warres, both according vnto their owne appetites, &amp; againſt the will of the ſayd Lord of <hi>Humiers,</hi> as euery man knoweth, who beſides that he was diſobeyed in his charge, being Lieutenant Generall for the King, was alſo in hazard of his life, which is a thing that I cannot ſo much mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell at: nor likewiſe at the arrogancie of the ſayd nation. But I muſt much more meruell at our negligence, ſeeing the iniuries that ſtraungers commonly do vnto vs, and that we notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ceaſe not to diſpraiſe the ſeruice of our countrimen, to become tributaries and ſubiects vnto ſtraungers: as if we could not do without them now, aſwell as wee haue done at other times, and alwaies vntill the time of King <hi>Lewes</hi> the 11. who was the firſt King of <hi>Fraunce</hi> that did giue penſion vnto ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, eſpecially vnto the Switzers, for he kept ordinarily in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:10495:15"/>
wages ſixe thouſand. King <hi>Charles</hi> the 8. followed him, who carried a great band to <hi>Naples.</hi> King <hi>Lewes</hi> the 12. ſerued him ſelf long time with them, and with Almaignes, and other ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. So likewiſe hath the King that raigneth at this preſent in all his warres: yet in the ende he perceiued that his ſubiects were as fit to ſerue him as ſtraungers; ſo that they were practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or if he hath not had y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> opinion of the Frenchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet he hath made a proofe of it. And to that ende (as I thinke) haue a very great number of Legionaries béen leuied in this realme, which number if it had béen leuied by a true election, had béen ſufficient to haue withſtood all our enemies. But the Frenchmens for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune would not that this leuie ſhould haue had his perfection: for that if this leuie had been made as it ought to haue been, wée ſhould haue been become their maiſters, vnto whom wee now are ſubiects. Wherfore it hath left vs in the ſame ſtate that wée haue béen learned to liue in many yeares ago: and for that wee make ſo little accompt of our owne forces, and do ſo much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme of ſtraungers, it may one day happen to be the occaſion of our ruine, if our neighbours ſhould enterpriſe ioyntly to come vpon vs. For one part alone hath put <hi>Fraunce</hi> in great feare: to weet, the Switzers, when as they came downe into <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundie,</hi> ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to make them to retier back againe it coſt vs great ſommes of monie. And ſo much fayled we of the courage to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent our ſelues in battell to reſiſt them, that the greateſt part made their accompt to make them place, and to runne out of the country. O almightie God! what was become of the ancient va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of <hi>Fraunce?</hi> At the name whereof all the nations both on this ſide, and on the other ſide of the ſea did tremble: and which was in poſſibilitie to aſſault other countries, and not to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at home, but by her owne: nor conſtrained to buy peace, ſith thoſe that ſould it vnto vs, were in fewe yeares before not able to reſiſt in their owne countrie, the armie of King <hi>Charles</hi> the 7. vnder the conduct of <hi>Lewis</hi> his ſonne, being at that time <hi>Daulphine,</hi> &amp; ſince king. We may beléeue that their comming down was for our profite, ſith they ſerue vs for an example, for by the great troubles that <hi>Fraunce</hi> was in: for 20. or 30. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Switzers, all a foote ill furniſhed with artillerie, and with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:10495:15"/>
all other things to inuade ſuch a countrie, may bee coniectured what it would do if the ſame Switzers ſhould come againe. And furthermore, if the Almaignes, Flemings, Engliſhmen, Spanyards, and Italians, ſhould come vpon vs with one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent, who could want nothing but good agreement, I could not imagine how we ſhould find meane to withſtand ſuch a coniuration. For to tarrie to make hed vnto them, were a much worſe counſaile then that of <hi>Monſiure Tremouille</hi> was, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the Switzers with crownes; becauſe that diſordred peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ill trained, and ill furniſhed, cannot ſerue for any other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe againſt people well ordred, well trained, and well furniſhed with armes, and withall that appertaineth vnto ſuch a buſines: but to harten and to encourage them the more. And as for vs to truſt vnto, that the frontiers are well furniſhed with ſtrong townes, is a hope euill aſſured: for whoſoeuer is Lord of the plaine countrie, I meane of ſo great and large a countrie as <hi>Fraunce</hi> is, ſhall eaſily afterward haue the vpper hand of the places that they keepe: principally when ſo great a number, or a great part of thoſe that I haue ſpoken of, ſhall enter in at diuers places, euery nation vpon his quarter, &amp; that they had deuided the countrie before hand. For elſe we might haue ſome reaſon to hope y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in forbearing, they might ſeperate themſelues through diſcord, or that a part taking might be practiſed: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding theſe things muſt haue time, and in the meane while wee ſhould ſuffer many euills to be committed before our eyes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remedie. And ſuppoſe that to ſee ſuch a deſolation to come to paſſe vpon ſo noble a realme, were almoſt a thing impoſſible: yet is there none more apparant remedie to withſtand it, and to take away from our ſayd enemies all the occaſions that might hinder them from the conceipt of this impoſſibilitie, then to make our ſelues ſtrong with our owne people: I meane ſo ſtrong, that thoſe that now do take penſion of vs, ſhould be very glad to be ſimplie allied vnto vs: and others which priuilie haue ſhewed themſelues to be our enemies, ſhould be conſtrayned to diſſemble: and thoſe which diſſemble, ſhould openly ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be our friends by good proofe. Which to bring to paſſe, I would not counſaile that our force ſhould be any whit mingled
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:10495:16"/>
with ſtraunge ſouldiers, aſwell for to haue the credite vnto our ſelues, when as our ſouldiers ſhould do any good ſeruice, as alſo to auoyde the great daungers that might happen by an armie made of many nations: for that is the occaſion oft times that our enemies do knowe our ſecrets almoſt aſſoone as they are ſpoken: except it ſhould be to weaken our enemies, or to content our confederats, and to get the good will of the countrie where the warres ſhould be made, as I thinke the King doth by the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talians: in waging of whom he thinketh to get the hearts of all <hi>Italie,</hi> &amp; in waging the Switzers to keepe them: and moreouer to take away the forces of <hi>Germanie</hi> from thoſe that might vſe them againſt him, except they retayned a great number. And if ſo be that the King would bee ſerued with any number of theſe nations, he may do it (as I thinke) forſeeing that his owne bée alwaies the ſtronger: and that he vſe ſtrangers as aſſiſtants, but not to giue them the preheminences and aduantages that they are accuſtomed to haue amongſt vs: as to haue the charge of the Artillerie, and commonly to make the battell, not being ſubiect vnto labours and aſſaults, as the Frenchmen are, who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies appoynted vnto the Auantgard, or Areregard, ſo that thoſe of leaſt value and ſtraungers, haue alwaies the credite of the battell, as thoſe whom wee ought to truſt aboue all others, without whom wee haue not the courage to enterpriſe the leaſt thing that may bee. I do not enuie them for the honor that is done vnto them, knowing well that the places wherein the Frenchmen ſerue bee very honorable, and that in them they may ſhew themſelues to be ſuch as they are, aſwell in the Arere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, as in the battell, and in the battell as in the Auantgard; it is all one: for there may be enough to do in euery place. But I would that the King ſhould haue ſo good an opinion of vs, as to thinke that he might bee aſwell ſerued of vs as of any other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and that he would not determine to make himſelfe ſtrong rather with Switzers and Almaignes, then with vs. For if they do now excell vs for order, wee may either bee equall vnto them, or better then they in a ſhort time. And for other poynts, I ſee no reaſon to eſteeme them more then our ſelues: and who ſo would narrowly looke into them, ſhall finde that they do ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:10495:16"/>
ſerue vs with their name then with their deedes, and rather to make number then otherwiſe: for that at this inſtant there is almoſt no battell giuen; for which they ſay they ſerue, and are waged only to that end. Moreouer, they go not to aſſaults nor ſkirmiſhes, nor ſuch other ſeruices; but all theſe ſeruices are for vs, which manner of warre is now more vſed then other: ſo that they ſerue and take their wages, not putting their perſons in daunger. They take it not as the Frenchmen do that ſerue the King: for they haue the payne and the daunger, and the ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers the profite and the reputation. One thing there is that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth greatly for the Switzers &amp; Almaignes, which is the good order that they haue amongſt them, aſwell for the raunging of their men in battell, as in obeying their Chiefs: wherof we haue a great want. Therefore we muſt prooue to take their courſe, or any other more ſure, and therein employ ſuch diligence, that if the king would be wholly &amp; euery where ſerued by vs, he might find himſelfe to bee well ſerued, and not repent the leauing of ſtraungers for vs. So it is, that by the ordaining of the legions, euery one thought that the cuſtome to wage other then French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, would haue bin laid aſide. But the king perceiuing that the leuie had many imperfections in it, and that it ſhould not haue béen wiſely done immediatly to reiect the ſeruice of others; hath therefore kept them, and a great part of our legions, and alſo certaine bands of aduenturers, both to content the one and the other, and to aſſure himſelf on euery ſide. But if the kings mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning had béen well executed in that which they ſhould haue done after theſe legions were ordayned, we might haue hoped that it would haue bin a very good time for vs. But whereas the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and officers ſhould haue taken paynes to trayne their ſouldiers well, they haue done nothing. It may be alſo that they had no expreſſe commaundement to do it: and thoſe that haue no great good willes of themſelues, do quickly finde an excuſe. I doubt alſo that the legionaries being leuied in that order that they were leuied in, would not well haue agréed vnto it: ſo that the fault proceeded of more cauſes then of one, but principally hereof that euery one was a voluntarie, and that there was none inroulled but of their owne freewill. And the cuſtome at
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:10495:17"/>
this day is, that thoſe that offer themſelues, are commonly the worſt of the countrie; for very hardly will a good houſeholder inroule himſelfe, or a quiet man that feareth God, and iuſtice, and loueth his neighbour: for theſe conditions agree not with the voluntarie ſouldiers of the time preſent, who are ſo vicious, that it is to bée feared that their ſeruice may do vs more hurt then our own ill fortune; foraſmuch as God is offended by them in all manner of ſorts. Beſides, they are but too valiant; but ſo euill conditioned, as it is not poſſible that they might bée more. I will not ſay that all the voluntaries are ſo; becauſe I ſhould do wrong vnto many honeſt men: but I ſpeake of the greateſt parte, and not of all: and as I ſay that they are ill conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſo I dare ſay that there is no good order in them, and they are not ſo obedient, as it is requiſite they ſhould bée, to exerciſe the arte of the warres as it ought to bée. Wherefore it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that a Captaine, how vertuous or diligent ſoeuer he bée, ſhould make his Souldiers to imitate the manners of the ſouldiers of the old time, who were men of ſo great a valour. Nor likewiſe can one of our Lieutenants Generall for the king, bring into his hoaſt, the manner which the armies in time paſt obſerued, aſwell in ordring, and raunging their battailes, as in fight: without imitating of which manner, it will be impoſſible to do any thing ought worth. The reaſon is, for that the ſtuffe, whereof our hoaſts are compounded and framed, is ſo euill of it ſelfe, that to think to applie it to any good vſe would be in vaine, and to hope to bring the arte Militarie vnto her firſt ſtate would be all one: for with leſſe labour would newe ſouldiers be forged, then thoſe which alreadie haue their ſhape, be reformed as they ought to be. But if it pleaſed the king to make a newe leuie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto a true electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which might afterward be inſtructed diligently in Martiall diſcipline; I beléeue aſſuredly that thoſe Souldiers would imitate the auncient Souldiers in all things, wherein they were thought to haue béen more excellent then thoſe, that haue béen ſince the feates of armes are come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And furthermore, a Generall might eaſilie eſtabliſh the ancient cuſtomes in his hoaſt, &amp; by that meanes the king ſhould find himſelf to be the beſt ſerued that euer was prince, and might
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:10495:17"/>
bragge that he had the beſt ſouldiers, and the beſt ordred men that were vpon the earth: and for to haue them to bee ſuch, it were neceſſarie for the firſt Item, that thoſe which ſhould bée choſen ſhould bee the moſt honeſt men, and men of beſt life that were poſſible to bée founde in the king his countrie, and for the reſt to leaue that vnto the Chiefs which ſhould haue the charge to traine them: for they might make them afterwards ſuch as they would haue them to be. And for to leuie theſe honeſt men of whome I ſpeake, the king ſhould at the firſt make a ſmall force, and conſtraine them to inroule themſelues, or the election would not bee perfect. And to the intent that this force ſhould giue no man diſcontentment, they muſt be wonne vnto it, with the hope of ſome profite, and honor in time to come, and of ſome priuiledges, which muſt bee promiſed vnto thoſe that ſhall do their indeuour: and that during the time that they ſhall ſerue, they ſhall haue wherewithall to maintaine themſelues honeſtly. Through this meanes, it ſhould not bee needfull to drawe any man by the eares: eſpecially if they knewe that the king would be diſcontented with thoſe that ſhould looke to bee prayed. In this doing the arte Militarie would returne to her firſt force, and the king ſhould bee the firſt that ſhould finde eaſe in it, and conſequently his people. The thefts which many Captaines do commit in their muſters ſhould haue no more place: &amp; the yerely penſions which ſtraungers haue, would make their end, neither would they runne as they are accuſtomed: becauſe he ſhould haue enowe of his owne: beſides, the ordring of them would be ſuch, as he ſhould not neede to doubt any thing but the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God: as for men they could not hurt him. And to bee ſhort, the people ſhould bee no more driuen away, eaten, nor pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laged by our owne ſouldiers as they are: alſo we ſhould bee ſo much the more aſſured againſt our enemies, and furthermore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched, or at the leaſt, the monie that the ſayd ſtraungers do car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie away, would tarrie with vs. All which things do make me to conclude, that the King ſhould do well to employ his owne people, as often as it ſhall bee neceſſarie to make warre for the profite and preſeruation of his realme: and ſhould repoſe all his defence in the vertue of the French armies, ſeeing that he hath
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:10495:18"/>
better meanes to do it then any prince liuing may haue, or any prince that hath béen euer had. And this my concluſion is ſo well prooued, that I need not to ſtay longer vpon this matter: but go forward to ſpeake mine opinion of the courſe that muſt be taken to make a newe leuie in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and to conduct it from degree to degree, vnto that poynt it muſt be brought vnto, to make the ſouldiers to be ſuch as I haue promiſed, and the armie to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible, and incomparable.</p>

Wherefore it were better to take a leſſe number of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to giue them reaſonable warres, then to take a great number, and to haue them the better cheape. And that the ſayd people might be of abilitie to apparell themſelues honeſtly twiſe a yeare, and defray their owne charges in going and comming from the muſters they ſhould make, without eating the people, as the ſouldiers do at this preſent. And moreouer, if they were called out to go to the warres, that from the day that they put themſelues in a readines to march, their pay ſhould bee ſo aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, that it might maintaine them in apparell and victuall, according vnto their qualitie. And the Chiefs, Members, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:10495:18"/>
Officers, ſhould be maintained both in time of peace and warre, with the ſame wages that the Legionaries had heretofore. As concerning that, I ſay wée ſhould take vp ſo many the leſſe: I meane, not that this number ſhould bee ſo greatly diminiſhed, but that being aſſembled, it might make the iuſt forme of an hoaſt: as ſome fiue and twentie thouſand footmen, or there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. For otherwiſe it would bée a leuying of men for to ſpend monie, but not to do ſeruice: ſpecially for that a ſmall number in ſhort time would come to nothing, becauſe of the infinite miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happes that oftimes happen vnto men, ſo that there muſt bee euer and anon newe men inroulled, to fill the bands that ſhould lacke. And for that the ſayd number could not bee raunged and exerciſed as they ought to bee, if they were leuied in places farre diſtant one from another: becauſe they could not be aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, when they ſhould bée trayned and exerciſed, without great expences: and it is a thing neceſſarie to bring them oftentimes together: for not being practiſed, they could not bee made ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceable.</p>
                     <p>It were good that the firſt leuie that ſhould be made, ſhould be ordained vpon the frontiers, who are moſt ſubiect vnto the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of their neighbours, in thoſe countries which lie neereſt adioyning together. As if wee doubted the Almaignes, this leuie might bee made in <hi>Campaigne, Burgundie,</hi> and <hi>Daulphine.</hi> And who ſo feared the Spanyards, might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and <hi>Guyne:</hi> for theſe are the countries bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers: and ſo likewiſe in others. Vpon which countries borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers the ſayd 25. thouſand men ſhould bee leuied, and ſhould be practiſed a yeare, two, or three, vntill that they might bee thought to be ſufficient good ſouldiers. And that terme expired, a newe leuie might be made in other places: who alſo ſhould bee practiſed as long. And afterward to followe in order through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the other countries and frontiers of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> vntill that all had been gone through, and then to begin a newe to bring into order thoſe that were firſt inroulled: and conſequently the ſecond, and afterwards the others. And that thoſe that ſhould reſt while th'others were trained (for I meane that there ſhould bee but the number aboueſayd maintained at once) ſhould bee
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:10495:19"/>
bound vpon paine of great puniſhment to exerciſe themſelues perticularly in their houſes, and together, if they might do it without expence, to the intent that they might alwaies remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and keepe that which had been ſhewed them touching the feate of the warre. The roules likewiſe of thoſe that lye ſtill ſhould bee kept in their intiere, not ſuffering any man in the meane while to bee diſcharged, nor that any mans name ſhould bee blotted out, but with the leaue of the Lord Conſtable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the king do giue him no wages for the time; becauſe that they might tarrie while their turne did come about, or bée imployed, if we had neede to defend our ſelues: for that they would be readier to be ſent for, and leuied, then if vpon euery oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion there ſhould be newe men, and newe roules made. This done, the king ſhould find that there would be a great number of men of warre leuied, and practiſed within ſixe yeares, which would bee ſo well ordred and fit for the warre, that the one halfe (to weet fiftie thouſand, for ſo many would the one halfe mount vnto, or very nere) would ſuffice to make reſiſtance vnto a whole world of enemies, and the King ſhould not feele how: ſith that he ſhould not wage but 25. thouſand at once, or thereabout.</p>
                     <p>But if this counſaile were miſliked, it would bee ſufficient to withſtand the ſodaine courſes of our neighbours, if the ſayd 25. thouſand ſhould be leuied vpon the foure frontiers, that are moſt in hazard of this daunger; which number might bee ordinarily maintained as is aforeſayd. And put caſe that this were done, or that I ſpake of before: wee muſt not therefore feare that the ſayd ſouldiers might do any diſorder in the countries that they are leuied in: (although me thinke it were to be doubted) for that all the diſorder that ſuch ſort of people can do is after two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: to wéet, among themſelues, or againſt others. As for the diſorder that may happen amongſt themſelues, while they are vnder their Enſignes, the lawes that are prouided for thoſe men that are leuied by way of ordinaries, do forſee into it; who puniſh greeuouſly quarrellers, mutins, and all other ſort of people that commmit any crime, as ſhall be ſhewed toward the ende of this booke. And there is nothing that can ſaue or defend them from gréeuous puniſhment what armies ſoeuer they were; becauſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:10495:19"/>
the King ſhall alwaies be ſtronger then they, and they muſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be taken at the holding vp of a finger, then that one offence ſhould eſcape vnpuniſhed. And when all is ſayd, the Almaigne ſouldiers do gouerne themſelues well vnder a lawe, and do well maintaine iuſtice amongſt them, who vſe in their countrie (I meane out of their great townes) a more greater libertie to do euill, then the moſt corrupted of ours in <hi>Fraunce:</hi> and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, contrarie vnto their nature and cuſtome, they ſubmit themſelues humbly vnto the iuſtice of a Prouoſt, when as they haue occaſion to go into a ſtraunge countrie, or when as they are leuied to tarrie at home vpon their owne dunghill. What would then in truth our ſouldiers do, who are bred in a countrie that is gouerned by lawes, &amp; which doth puniſh offences more rigorouſly then any other that is knowne: truely me thinke that they would liue at the leaſt as honeſtly as the Almaignes do, and alſo would not be leſſe obedient vnto their Chiefs, and vnto thoſe whom they ought to obey. Touching the faults that they may commit at home amongſt their neighbours, the ordinarie Iuſtice of the place where they dwell will puniſh them: as the King his declarations made vpon this poynt do inſtruct vs: by which he prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth, that the iuſtice of the Colonells ſhould take place for the offences of their Legionarie ſouldiers, but only while they were in campe, or elſewhere vnder their Enſignes: of whom they are to execute good and ſhort puniſhment: but when they are returned, or that they are not leuied to go into the feeld, the ordinarie iuſtice ſhould puniſh them. But if ſo bée that the ſayd ſouldiers would exempt themſelues from the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie iuſtice by force, and that through their great number they would bee the readier and boulder to do miſchiefe, in ioyning themſelues together, or make any ſhewe to leuie themſelues without expreſſe commaundement of their Colonells, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ouerrunne and ſpoyle the countrie, or to vſe force vnto any man: in theſe caſes it may bee lawfull for the people to riſe, and to put themſelues in armes to ſtrengthen iuſtice if it were required; without whoſe authoritie, or the commaundement of ſome royall officer, and that alſo of the chiefeſt ſort, I am not of opinion that the people ſhould riſe: for it is to be feared that they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:10495:20"/>
would do more inſolencies then the ſouldiers themſelues, as did thoſe that lately roſe at <hi>Tours</hi> and thereabout: who in fewe daies did more hurt and domage vnto honeſt men, and vnto the places they paſſed through, then the malefactors whome they purſued, had done in all the time that they kept the feelds.</p>
                     <p>And after this manner I beleeue wee ought to vnderſtand the king his inſtitutions made in the yeare 1523. by which he permitteth the people to defend their goods againſt a companie of henne eaters, which do ſometimes thruſt themſelues vpon the countrie without commiſſion. But for that it is a moſt hard matter that ſouldiers ſhould commit any offence but that the Chiefes ſhould immediatly bee informed of it, who oftentimes make ſhewe not to vnderſtand of their faults, being negligent in reforming them: yea and ſometimes giue them example to do euill: ſo that the miſdemeanour of the Souldiers doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede aſmuch of the Captaine his fault, as of the euill diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Souldiers. Therefore I ſay, it muſt bee narrowly looked into, that thoſe wicked Chiefs may be puniſhed with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, to the intent that they may bee an example vnto others their like to amend themſelues: and vnto the good to bée more carefull to puniſh their euill doers. And if this leuie ſhould bée thought daungerous, for the aduauntage it might giue vnto Colonells, who might ſo winne their Souldiers hearts, as that they might vſe them at their willes, through their long autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie ouer them, and continuall frequentation. The ſureſt way would bee oftentimes to chaunge Colonells, and to giue ſuch charges vnto thoſe that before had made ſome proofe of their loyaltie vnto the king, and then it would not be to be feared that they ſhould helpe themſelues with their forces againſt the king, nor his ſubiects, as I thinke. For there is no man in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> but had rather continue poore in his obedience, being accompted for an honeſt man, then to ſerue his enemies to become rich, and to be accompted for a traytor and a wicked man. But if perhaps there were any Colonell that would make profe of any commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by meanes of his authoritie, the King ſhould alwaies bee ſtrong enough to ouerthrowe him, and to cut his followers in péeces with little difficultie. This inconuenience then need no
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:10495:20"/>
more to be doubted; becauſe that thoſe that heretofore encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the people to riſe, are extinct, and their Dutchies and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries ioyned vnto the Crowne: inſomuch that there is no man in <hi>Fraunce</hi> that dare perſwade any Souldier to put himſelfe into the feeld, to diminiſh the King his authoritie, nor to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe againſt his Maieſtie. And although he ſhould thinke to do it, who is there to fauour him againſt the Kings power?</p>

For when any of theſe ſhould commit any crime, or ſhould runne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, his goods and lands might then pay the reckoning, which might be inroulled in the kings booke: the ſeruice of whom ought to be preferred before a perticular profite. For this leuie is not only profitable vnto the king; but alſo moſt neceſſarie for all his ſubiects: for that we haue not the worth of one haire well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, without armes: becauſe that ſtraungers are rather like to hurt, then helpe vs; without whoſe ayd (hauing no ſouldiers of our owne) we ſhould at all times be eaten, and tormented by our neighbours. Sith then, that armes are ſo neceſſarie for vs, as that we cannot be without them, who is he that would haue all ſet at ſixe and ſeauen? We may exerciſe armes, and yet not leaue our owne buſines vndone, becauſe the ſouldiers may bee bound to aſſemble only vpon idle daies to practiſe their armes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: which would neither be hurtfull vnto the people nor coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie: but rather recreate yong men, that otherwiſe ſpend their time vpon holidaies in running to the Tauernes, for want of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther honeſt paſtime, eſpecially the exerciſe of armes, whereunto I am ſure they would go more willingly. For as it is a great pleaſure vnto the beholders to ſee the managing of armes: ſo likewiſe would it greatly delight yong men to handle and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe them. Moreouer, I ſay that it is not ſo newe a thing, but that the like hath been heretofore vſed in <hi>Fraunce:</hi> to weet, the exerciſing of armes, throughout the townes and villages of the kingdome, and prizes ſet vp for the beſt deſeruers: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my ſayings ought not to be thought ſtraunge nor hurtfull: for I ſpeake not of any thing that hath not been before ordained by the kings of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and in our time, by the king that raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth at this preſent. But leauing that aſide, let vs ſay that in the election of the people here ſpoken of, there ought to bee a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard had of their age: we muſt chooſe them then from 17. yeares old, to 35. For it was forbidden by an auncient lawe made by <hi>Caius Gracchus</hi> when he was Conſull in <hi>Rome,</hi> to chooſe any
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:10495:21"/>
yonger then 17. yeres of age: and in my iudgement, any yonger could not indure the labours appertayning vnto the warres. And who ſo ſhould inroule them of 35. or at the vttermoſt 40. ſhould take them too aged to inſtruct them well in the feates of armes, and to ſerue himſelfe with them afterwards 15. or 20. yeares, or more, according vnto the Kings affayres, or his good pleaſure. For in times paſt the ſouldiers followed the warres ſometime twentie yeres, and ſometime thirtie, or fourtie yeres, as is to be ſeene in the firſt booke of <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi> where he ſpeaketh of the chaunges of the Legions that were in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garie,</hi> who during all that time of their lying there, nor at any time elſe, could not withdrawe themſelues from their bands, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they would incurre y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paynes that fugitiues deſerued, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaue of the Senate, or of the Emperour: likewiſe they were in the ende well recompenced for their long ſeruice, when the legions were diſcharged, either in monie, or in lands, which the Senate diſtributed vnto euery one according vnto his qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, or the Emperour himſelfe ſometimes of his owne, not touching the common treaſure. And as for the looking into the facultie, and to coniecture thereby the goodnes, or lazines of a ſouldier, it maketh no matter ſo that he be fit to exerciſe the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of the warres. Yet in truth I would ſomewhat forſee to ſerue my ſelfe with the greateſt commoditie that I might: for there are occupations that are very neceſſarie for an armie, as Bakers, Armourers, Spur-makers, Carpenters, Wheele-wrights, men that are accuſtomed to worke in Mines, Shooe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, Taylers, Sadlers, and ſuch like, of all which it would be good to take a great number: for they may ſerue with their occupations when need requireth, and do the duetie of ſouldiers alſo.</p>
                     <p>As touching the knowing of them by their phiſnomie, that are fit to beare armes, that ſhall be left vnto thoſe that haue no experience of the warres, for it will ſuffice the others that haue experience, to looke that they haue ſound limmes: and whether they bee reputed to bee honeſt men in the townes and villages where they are taken vp. The beſt tokens to knowe them by, that are fitteſt for this occupation, are liuely and quicke eyes,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:10495:22"/>
ſtraight headded, high breaſted, large ſhoulders, long armes, ſtrong fingers, little bellied, great thighes, ſlender legges, and drie feete; all which poynts are comely in any man who ſo might finde them ordinarily: becauſe he that is ſo ſhaped, cannot fayle to be nimble and ſtrong; which are two qualities to bee greatly required in all good ſouldiers: notwithſtanding, we muſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe thoſe that haue not all theſe qualities before ſpoken of, ſo that otherwiſe they be ſound. Aboue all things we muſt haue a regard that theſe newe men bee honeſtly conditioned, according vnto their qualitie, and that they bee not ſuch as make of vice a vertue: for elſe it would bée a chuſing of inſtruments to make newe diſorders euery day, and to corrupt others that of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues are worth nothing: ſith that in an ill minde, a diſhoneſt bodie, and a cankered heart, there can neuer enter nor dwell any poynt of vertue. If then the ſouldiers may be found well condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned at the firſt, there muſt bee order taken that they may ſo continue while they are in their bands, and therefore it ſhould be neceſſarie that they might alwaies be occupied to kéepe them from idlenes: and this occupation ſhould be either in doing their owne buſines, or in exerciſing their armes, which they might vſe vpon holidaies, and vpon other daies attend vnto their own buſines, and labour in their ſcience: and they that haue no occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, ought to bee conſtrained to learne one within a certaine time. I ſpeake of thoſe that are no gentlemen, to the intent that they may haue maintenaunce, when as the warres are ended, that haue no lands. In this doing the king ſhould finde himſelfe without compariſon to bee better ſerued of them, then he is of thoſe who make the warres their occupation. At the vttermoſt, if the danger that might happen by this leuie ſhould be thought to be aſmuch as the profite, or more, and that the king his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell reſted vpon this concluſion, that it were more ſure for to let his commons to ſleepe in time of peace, then to awake them by putting armes into their hands. At the leaſt, me thinke that when warres did happen, and when there is queſtion to leuie men in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> wee ought to helpe our ſelues in chuſing ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers after this manner: and that they ſhould be compelled to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roule themſelues in ſuch ſort as I haue ſayd, for which there
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:10495:22"/>
muſt be good authoritie giuen vnto the Captaines, and likewiſe good time to chooſe and leuie them in. As for to leuie them, as we are accuſtomed, it hath no order in it; I meane if wee will haue men of ſeruice: for in this caſe the Captaines are conſtrained to receiue all that come vnto them, aſwell the good as the bad: and ſometimes the worſt do make themſelues to be intreated, and to bee bought dearer then if they were any thing worth, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they muſt bee had if it were but to fill vp the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. I would therefore that the Captaines might haue more time to make their bands then they haue, in which time they ſhould bee bound to vſe great diligence in trayning their men: and in trayning them to march toward the place of meeting, making ſmall iornies to exerciſe them vpon the way.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter that theſe men are choſen, and inroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, they muſt bee armed the beſt and ſureſt way that may bee deuiſed, and in ſuch ſorte, that they may haue an aduauntage of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men. For which cauſe, me thinke it were good to examine what armes the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſouldiers did beare, and thoſe that wee do vſe at this day, to the intent to take thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> might be thought moſt ſureſt. The Romanes deuided their footmen into heauie armed men, and into light armed men. They called their light armed men <hi>Velites,</hi> vnder which word were vnderſtood all thoſe that vſed Slings, Darts, and Bowes: the greateſt part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (as ſaith <hi>Polibius</hi>) were armed with a Sallet, and carried a Target vpon their armes to couer themſelues, and fought with out order a good diſtance from their heauie armed men. Thoſe that were heauie armed, had a head-peece y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> came down to their ſhoulders, and were armed vpon their bodies with curets,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:10495:23"/>
whoſe taſſes did couer them vnto the knees. Moreouer, their armes and legges were armed, and they carried a Shield that was foure foote long, and two foote broade, which Shield was bound with yron aloft and belowe, to keepe it from cleauing and wearing, and in the middeſt of it was a boſſe of yron faſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to abide blowes the better. Beſides that, they had a ſword girt to their left ſides, on their right ſides a ſhort dagger, and in their hands a Darte called <hi>Pilum,</hi> which they threwe when they began the combate. Some wrighters do ſay, that beſides the foreſayd Shield, they carried a Pike, namely the ſouldiers of <hi>Greece;</hi> but that ſhould ſeeme impoſſible, for as much as they would haue béen troubled enough to haue vſed one of thoſe weapons alone: and as for to vſe them both at once, would haue been but little for their eaſe, for the Pike a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone requireth both handes. On the other part, the Shield ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued but only to couer them, becauſe it was not very maniable, nor likewiſe would the Target bee handled very well: for it would bee too comberſome, except that at the beginning of the combate they ſhould vſe the Pike, hanging their Targets vpon their backes, and entring the approach ſo neere that the Pike might ſtand them in no more ſteade, they then caſting it from them, might helpe themſelues with their Targets and their Swordes. And as for thoſe that do carrie the Pike, as if they could carrie nothing elſe: I ſay that if they did but thruſt with their Pikes, the Target might hinder them nothing at all, although they ſhould beare it in that manner that it ought to bee borne. The <hi>Greekes</hi> laded not themſelues with ſo heauie harnes as the <hi>Romanes</hi> did, but they gaue themſelues more to the vſe of the Pike, principally the <hi>Phalanges</hi> of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> who carried Pikes of ten cubites long, called <hi>Sariſſes,</hi> with the which they enforced their enemies to beate their rankes, and yet kept themſelues in order: but ſith the <hi>Romanes</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the whole world, wee may beleeue that they were the beſt armed of all others.</p>
                     <p>The faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at this day is to arme a foot man with a corſelet co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plet, or with a ſhyrt of male, and a head-piece, which me think is ſuffcient for the defence of a man, and I finde our manner of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:10495:23"/>
to be better then the <hi>Romanes.</hi> And as for our offenſiue weapons, we do carry the ſword as they did, but ſomewhat longer: the other weapons are the Pike, the Halbard, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſan, the Harquebuſſe, and many others leſſe in vſe amongſt Souldyers, and the Target, but that there is but little accompt made of it, except it be for ſome aſſault, neither is there almoſt any man that will lade himſelfe with it, except Captaines. The Harquebuſſe hath bin inuented within theſe fewe yeares, and is verie good, ſo that it be vſed by thoſe that haue ſkill, but at this preſent euery man will be a Harquebuſier: I knowe not whether it be to take the more wages, or to be the lighter laden, or to fight the further off, wherein there muſt be an order taken, to appoint fewer Harquebuſiers, and thoſe that are good, then many that are worth nothing: for this negligence is cauſe that in a ſkirmiſh wherein tenne thouſand Harquebuſſados are ſhot, there dieth not ſo mutch as one man, for the Harquebuſiers content themſelues with making of a noyſe, and ſo ſhoote at all aduentures. The Halbards are armes newly inuented as I thinke by the <hi>Switzers,</hi> which are very good, ſo that they be ſtrong and ſharpe, and not light, as thoſe that the <hi>Italians</hi> do carry, more to make a faire ſhewe (as I thinke) then for any goodneſſe that is in them, becauſe they are too weake, and ſo likewiſe are the Pertiſans, which being ſtronger and better ſtéeled, might do good ſeruice againſt naked men, but againſt men that are well armed, they can do no great deede. Amongſt other weapons leaſt accuſtomed, are the Bowe and the Croſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowe, which are two weapons that may do very good ſeruice againſt vnarmed men, or thoſe that are ill armed, ſpecially in wet weather, when the Harquebuſier loſeth his ſeaſon. And were it ſo that the archers and croſſebow men could carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them their prouiſion for their bowes and croſſebowes, as eaſily as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Harquebuſiers may do theirs for their Harquebuſſe: I would commend them before the Harquebuſſe, as well for their readineſſe in ſhooting, which is mutch more quicker, as alſo for the ſureneſſe of their ſhot, which is almoſt neuer in vayne. And although the Harquebuſier may ſhoote further, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Archer and Croſſebow man will kill a C. or CC.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:10495:24"/>
paſes off, aſwell as the beſt Harquebuſier: and ſometime the harneſſe, except it be the better, can not hold out: at the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the remedy is that they ſhould be brought as neere before they do ſhoote as poſſibly they may, and if it were ſo handled, there would be more ſlaine by their ſhot, then by twice as many Harquebuſiers, and this I will prooue by one Croſſebow man that was in <hi>Thurin,</hi> when as the Lord Marſhall of <hi>Annibault</hi> was Gouernour there, who, as I haue vnderſtood, in fiue or ſixe ſkirmiſhes, did kill and hurt more of our enemyes, then fiue or ſixe of the beſt Harquebuſiers did, during the whole time of the ſiege. I haue heard ſay of one other only that was in the army that the King had vnder the charge of <hi>Mounſieur de Lautrec,</hi> who ſlewe in the battaile of <hi>Bycorque</hi> a Spaniſh Captaine called <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Cardone,</hi> in the lifting vp of his helmet. I haue ſpoken of theſe two ſpecially, becauſe that being employed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt great ſtore of Harquebuſiers, they made themſelues to be ſo knowne, that they deſerued to be ſpoken of: what would a great number of ſutch do? But let vs paſſe further to ſpeake of the Pike, of which, although the <hi>Switzers</hi> haue not béen the inuenters, yet haue they at the leaſt brought it againe into vſe, for that they being poore, and deſirous to liue at libertie, were conſtrained to fight againſt the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ritch, and of great power, did maintaine many Horſſemen, which the ſaid <hi>Switzers</hi> could not do: and therfore making their warres afoote, they were conſtrained to runne vnto the auncient manner, and out of it to chooſe ſome armes wherewith they might defend themſelues from the enemies Horſſemen, which neceſſitie hath made them either to maintaine, or to finde out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the orders of times paſt, without which Pikes, footemen are wholly vnprofitable. They tooke therefore Pikes as wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons not only fit for to withſtand Horſſemen, but alſo to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh them: by the help of which weapon, and through the truſt they haue in their owne good order, they haue taken ſutch a boldneſſe, that fifteene, or twenty thouſand of their men dare enterpriſe vpon a whole world of Horſſemen, as they haue made proofe at <hi>Nouare,</hi> and at <hi>Marignan,</hi> although the one battaile fell out better on their ſide then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other. The examples
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:10495:24"/>
of the vertue that theſe people haue ſhewed to be in them for their feates of armes afoote, haue cauſed ſince the voyage of king <hi>Charles</hi> the 8. other nations to imitate them, ſpecially the <hi>Germains</hi> and <hi>Spanyards,</hi> who are mounted vnto the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that we do hould them of at this day, by imitating the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that the ſayd <hi>Switzers</hi> do kéepe, and the manner of armes they do carry. The <hi>Italians</hi> afterward haue giuen themſelues vnto it, and we laſtly: but we are ſo farre off, that we ſhall neuer be like vnto them for order, except we do make the vſe of theſe weapons to be of more eſtimation amongſt vs then it hath bin hitherto, ſo mutch there is alſo, that they can learne vs no other point. We muſt therefore take paines to get this order, or if it be poſſible, to finde or frame a more ſure, by the meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we might defend our ſelues, and excell other nations. And to do this, we muſt arme our Souldiers well, to the intent that they may be leſſe in daunger of blowes, and the harder to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne: principally thoſe that ſhould ſerue in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt fronts of the battailes, and alſo all others if it were poſſible, euery man according vnto the weapon that he doth carry. The armes that we muſt carry muſt be theſe, firſt of all the Corſlet complet, with the taſſes downe to the knée, hoſe of male, a codpeece of yron, good vambraces, and gauntlets, or gloues of male, and a good headpeece with a ſight almoſt couered. The other harneſſe for the body muſt be a a ſhirt or Ierkin with ſléeues, &amp; gloues of male, and a headpeece with the face vncouered. The weapons muſt be theſe, a ſword of meane length, which ſhould be worne of a reaſonable height, neither wholly after the manner of the <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> nor altogether like vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>Almaigns:</hi> for the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of it too lowe doth greatly trouble a Souldier. The ſhort dagger alſo is one of the moſt neceſſarieſt weapons, wherewith in a preaſe a man may better help himſelfe then with a ſword. The Pike, &amp; halbard, and amongſt many halbards ſome Perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans are alſo called weapons. The Target may not be called a weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding it is a very good péece. The Harquebuſſe likewiſe muſt be accompted amongſt weapons, and the Bowe and Croſſebowe alſo. True it is that I would that theſe two laſt ſhould be caried by the people of the Countrey where they
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:10495:25"/>
haue their moſt courſe, and but a certaine number of them. Thoſe that do carry Pikes, ſhould be deuided into ordinaries, and extraordinaries. The ordinaries ſhould be armed with a Corſlet in manner as is aboueſaid, and ſhould moreouer carry a Target at their backs, wherwith they might help themſelues after that they are come ſo néere vnto the enemy that the Pike could do them no more ſeruice, they might therewith alſo couer themſelues from Bowmen and Croſſebowes, &amp; at aſſaults, for aſmuch as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pike is there a thing almoſt vnprofitable. And my ſaying muſt not be thought to be ſtrange, for that I lade theſe men with ſo many kinds of harneſſe, for I ſéeke but to arme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſurely, as men that muſt tarry by it, ought to be armed, and not like vnto thoſe that arme themſelues lightly; who being ill ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, do thinke rather to runne away then to vanquiſh. I take alſo mine example from the <hi>Romanes,</hi> who armed their ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers which they appointed for their battailes, as heauy as they might poſſible to make them to ſtand the ſurer againſt their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, &amp; that féeling their bodies ſo laden with harneſſe, they ſhould not hope to ſaue themſelues by flight, but to dye in the place, or to win the victory. <hi>Vegetius</hi> complaineth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in his time were too light armed, and followed not the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Romanes,</hi> who commonly did ſurpaſſe &amp; vanquiſh their enemies, becauſe they were alwaies well armed, and the others ill armed. If our ſouldiers will then be accompted for to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianter men then their neighbors, it is neceſſary that they ſhould arme themſelues as ſure as they might poſſibly, chiefely thoſe that ſhould be the force of the battailes, and ſo likewiſe ſhould y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> others that are for ſkirmiſhes, to giue their enemies the more trouble to defend themſelues, and to be of the more force to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt them. And for this intent I ſay that the extraordinary Piks ſhould be armed with curets, ſléeues of male, and with a good headpéece. The halbards ſhould be armed likewiſe after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame manner: and the Harquebuſiers, Archers, and croſſebowmen ſhould be armed with a ſhirt &amp; ſléeues of male, and with a good headpeece: or for want of a ſhirt of male, they ſhould haue cotes of plate, and good Iacks, yet they are almoſt out of ſeaſon, but that maketh no matter, ſo there be any aduantage to be found
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:10495:25"/>
by them. They ought to be furniſhed of all theſe armes by the King, but the armes ſhould be better choſen then thoſe were that were giuen vnto the other Legionares. The Captaines muſt haue a care to diſperſe theſe armes, and to diſtribute them as they ought to be, giuing the heauyeſt armes, to wéet, the Pikes and Halbards, vnto the greateſt and ſtrongeſt men, and thoſe which were meet to be handled by nimble fellows, ſhould be giuen vnto the leſſer ſort of men, not forgetting to inrowle the armes and weapons that euery man doth take vpon him to beare, to make them to be coumptable for them, and to puniſh thoſe that ſhould alter their armes without leaue: for that after a Souldyer hath taken vpon him to carry a Pike, he may not take vppon him to carry a Harquebuſſe, without leaue of the <hi>Colonel:</hi> nor the Harquebuſſier may not take a Pike or a Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard: for that if the Souldyers ſhould be at libertie to change armes at their pleaſure, the number of euery ſort of armes would increaſe, or decreaſe at all houres: and I do intend that the number of euery ſort of armes ſhould be alwayes one, to raunge the Legions in battaile the readier. And if it ſhould happen any of thoſe that ſhould make the bodie of the battaile to dye, or to be ſicke, or to runne away, becauſe the place ſhould not be emptie, there muſt one of the Pikes of the flanks be put in his place. Of theſe Pikes of the flanks ſhall be more ſpoken of héereafter. When as the armes are diſtributed, euery Captaine ought to furniſh himſelfe with certaine honeſt men, amongſt whome, he ſhall chooſe one of the moſt vertuous for his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and another for his Enſigne bearer, and the other for Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers: and for that theſe Offices ought commonly to be ſerued by Gentlemen, and I haue ſaid before that Gentlemen ſhould be exempted out of the leuy, at the firſt they muſt not be offered any wrong. But if ſo be that they do once inrowle themſelues, they ſhalbe bound afterward to ſerue the King in the ſame ſort, and as long as the ſimpleſt of the Legionaries, and not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged after they haue once giuen their names, vntill the King do giue them leaue. It were good that a certaine tearme ſhould be limited, as 15. yeares, or more, at the King his diſcretion.</p>

And for that the <hi>Romanes</hi> (as ſayth <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getius</hi>) made their Legions of ſixe thouſand and one hundred men, I will make theſe Legions which I do ordaine, to be of the ſame number, and will afterwards deuide the ſaid number into twelue bands, and therein I ſhall differ from them: for they deuided their Legions into tenne bands, of which they made their Battailons, and I will do as they did, and yet haue two bands for the <hi>Forlorne hope,</hi> for ſo I will tearme them that ſhall begin the Battaile. Euery one of the tenne Bands ſhall be gouerned by a Captaine, and vnder euery Captaine there ſhall be a Lieutenant, and an Enſigne bearer, one Sergeant of the Band, a Clarke, two Drums, and one Phife: and beſides theſe members, and officers, euery Captaine ſhall haue fiue C. &amp; ten men vnder his charge, the which ſhall be deuided into ſixe ſmall companies, which ſix Corporals or Centeniers ſhall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne, of which Corporals, fiue ſhall be reſerued for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of the Battailon, &amp; the ſixt ſhall ſerue for the flanks. Vnder euery Corporall there ſhall be four Chefs of Squadrons, vnder euery
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:10495:26"/>
Chefe there ſhall be two Deciniers, and vnder euery Decinier ſhall be nine men, ſo that euery Chefe of ſquadron ſhall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne twentie men, &amp; he himſelfe ſhall be the one and twentith. The Corporall ſhall be Chefe of <hi>85.</hi> with his owne perſon. Foure of theſe Corporalls ſhall haue all their men to carry Pikes, and the fift ſhall haue all his to be Halbardiers, except that for to arme the flanks of the Halbardiers, euery one of the Deciniers vnder this Corporall ſhall haue thrée Pikemen, and all the reſt ſhall be Halbardiers. Thoſe of the ſixt Corporall ſhalbe the one halfe Pikemen, &amp; the other halfe Harquebuſſiers, except that we would mingle ſome Archers amongſt them, and make that the one chiefe of ſquadron ſhould haue all his men to be Harquebuſiers, and that the other chiefe of ſquadron ſhould haue one Decene of his men to be all Archers, and the other Decene to be all Croſſebowes, to the intent to haue ſeruice of theſe people, in places where the Harquebuſiers ſhould be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruiceable, as in the rayne, as is aforeſaid, or to make any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret charge where the fire might diſcouer them, or in any other place where theſe two weapons might ſerue more ſure then the Haquebuſſe. The two bands of the <hi>Forlorne hope</hi> ſhall be <hi>868.</hi> men, ſo that either of them ſhall be <hi>434.</hi> men, one of this number ſhall be Captaine, and he ſhall haue the like number of members and officers that one of the ten Captaines haue in charge, and the reſt ſhall be deuided into fiue ſmall companies, which ſhall be gouerned by fiue Corporals, euery one of which ſhall haue as many ſquadrons and men, as one of the aboueſaid Corporals hath. Foure of theſe Corporals ſhall haue all their men Harquebuſiers, which may be mingled with Archers and Croſſebowes who ſo would. And the fift ſhall haue all his Pikemen, which ſhall be called extraordinaries, becauſe they ſhall fight out of order, not kéeping ranke. The number of the Souldyers of all theſe twelue bands, is ſixe M. and ſeauentie. Beſides all which, there muſt be one chiefe Officer, aboue all the Captaines, who ſhall be called the Colonel, and he ſhall haue for his officers theſe that follow, to wéete, a maiſter of the Camp, a Sergeant Maior, a Prouoſt, and vnder the Prouoſt ſome wiſe man to aſſiſt him in his iudgements, and to counſaile
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:10495:27"/>
him touching the adminiſtration of iuſtice. The ſaid Prouoſt ſhall alſo haue a Clarke, certaine Sergeants, and a Hangman. Furthermore it is neceſſary that the ſaid Colonel ſhould haue a miniſter or two to do the diuine ſeruice, &amp; to adminiſter the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments vnto all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Legion. There muſt alſo be a Phiſition, a Pothecary, &amp; a Chirurgeon, &amp; ſome one that hath ſkill to make fireworks, &amp; powder, &amp; an Armorer, &amp; the reſt vntil the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>30.</hi> places, with thoſe that I haue now ſpecified, may be reſerued for the Colonel his gard. After y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the number aforeſaid is ſo diſtributed, there muſt be names giuen vnto the Captains, the one muſt be named the firſt, another y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſecond, &amp; another the third, fourth, fift, ſixt, ſeuenth, eight, nine, &amp; tenth: and the other two ſhall be called Captaines of the <hi>Forlorne hope.</hi> And all the <hi>12.</hi> Enſignes ought to be of one colour, &amp; to haue ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in faſhion, or ſome barres to be knowne the better, and the readier to find the places that they ought to kéep in battaile. It were not amiſſe that the Souldiers were apparrelled like the colour of their Enſignes, to be the better knowne, and had ſome token or cogniſance wherby the ſouldiers of the one band might be knowne from thoſe of the other. The Chefes &amp; offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers ſhould haue their head-péeces couered with ſome colour, or ſhould haue ſkarfes whereby they might be knowne a farre off. In the manner aforeſaid would I diſtribute a Legion: for it is the beſt way that I knowe to raunge a Battailon in ſuch ſort, that it might be as it were inuincible. And if it ſhould ſéeme too hard to raunge this Legion in battaile in that forme that I will ſpeake of héere following, &amp; that the forme which we do vſe at this preſent, in raunging our Legions, were thought to be more eaſy &amp; ſure, &amp; likewiſe that their manner &amp; order were better li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, then the Legions that I pretend to erect; yet I am of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that the bands of the ſaid Legions ſhould be deuided in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort then they yet haue bin, for they would be in better order to do any good ſeruice, then they now are, although their order be not euill ſuch as it is. As for me I would order them after this manner, that is, that euery one of the <hi>6.</hi> Captains which the King hath apointed vnto euery Legion, ſhould haue <hi>4.</hi> Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals or Centeniers, all of ordinary Pikes, and <hi>3.</hi> other Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:10495:27"/>
whoſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one halfe Pikes, &amp; the other halfe Halbards, to wéet, <hi>2.</hi> Squadrons of the one, &amp; <hi>2.</hi> ſquadrons of the other: euery one of which <hi>6.</hi> Corporals ſhould haue vnder him <hi>4.</hi> Chiefs of ſquadrons, &amp; euery Chief of ſquadron <hi>2.</hi> Dece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neirs, and euery Decenier ſhould haue charge of <hi>11.</hi> me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by this meanes euery ſquadron ſhould haue <hi>25.</hi> men, and the ſixe Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teniers ſhould haue euerie one <hi>100.</hi> ſouldiers vnder him: which Centeniers ſhould be for the bodie of the battel. And as for the flankes euerie Captaine ſhoulde finde a Centenier which Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenier hath fower Chiefs of ſquadrons vnder him, and vnder e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Chiefe of ſquadron are two Deceniers, and vnder euerie Decenier <hi>10.</hi> men. Two of which ſaid ſquadrons ſhoulde be Pikes, and the other two Harquebuſiers, the one of the three Centeniers, which reſt to make vp the ten, which are vnder e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one of the aboueſaid Captaines ſhould haue all Pikemen, which ſhould be <hi>93.</hi> in number, the perſone of the Centenier comprehended, and the two other Centeniers of equall number, ſhould haue all Harquebuſiers, &amp; all thoſe three Centeniers and their men ſhalbe called the forlorne hope, and ſhal ſerue for that purpoſe: ſo may euerie band of a thouſand men bee diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and yet there would be left <hi>28.</hi> places, the which ſhould bee for the Captaine and his two Lieutenants, the two Enſigne bearers, fower Sergeants of the bande, two Harbingers, two Drommes, and two Fifes. And for that the ſixe Cente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers that were reſerued to make the body of the battaile are not comprehended within the number of their people, they ſhalbe accompted with this number to fill vp the the <hi>28.</hi> places: and yet there will remaine fiue places, which may ſerue the Colonel, for the officers, and garde that hee ought to haue: and by that meanes there ſhoulde bee in euerie bande <hi>504.</hi> ordinarie Pike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <hi>102.</hi> Halberdiers: and to arme the flankes <hi>46.</hi> ordinarie Pikes, and as many Harquebuſiers, beſides the perſon of the Centenier. And for the forlorne hope there would be <hi>93.</hi> extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie Pikes, and <hi>186.</hi> Harquebuſiers: which make in all <hi>978.</hi> the <hi>22.</hi> places y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> remaine are for the Chiefs, Members, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and for the Colonell his gard as I haue ſaid before. By that accompte there woulde bee in a Legion, <hi>3024.</hi> ordinarie
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:10495:28"/>
Pikes: <hi>612.</hi> Halbards. For the flanks there would be <hi>282.</hi> Pikes, and <hi>282.</hi> Harquebuſiers, and for the forlorne hope there would be <hi>358.</hi> Pikes, and <hi>1116.</hi> Harquebuſiers. The ouer plus is for the places of Chiefs, Members, Officers and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as is a foreſaid. Touching the manner that I woulde ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue to range one of theſe Legions in battaile, ſhalbe ſhewed after the ſpeaking of certaine ſmall perticular things, and after that I haue ranged one of theſe Legions in battell, which I will order after the auncient manner, which being deuided as I haue ſhewed before, ſhoulde conſiſt of <hi>3600.</hi> ordinarie Pikes, heerein comprehended the <hi>240.</hi> Pikes which ſhoulde arme the flankes of the Halbards, and <hi>600.</hi> Halbards, all which ſerue for the body of the Batailon. Now for the flanks there ſhould be <hi>420.</hi> Pikemen, and <hi>420</hi> Harquebuſiers: and beſides theſe ten Corporalls to gouerne them. As for the forlorne hope, there ſhoulde bee <hi>680.</hi> Harquebuſiers and <hi>170.</hi> Pikemen, all which doe amount vnto <hi>5900.</hi> men, the reſt are Chiefs, Members, and Officers, of the whole Legion, who are not comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in this nomber. And if ſo bee the ſaide number of Harquebuſiers ſhould bee thought to bee too little, they may be augmented and certaine bands made a parte, beſides the Legion, which Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuſiers may be named properly aduentures, or extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, foraſmuch as they ſhould be leuied and entertained, during the warres, and no longer. That which is here ſpoken may ſuffice, touching the diuiſion, but we muſt come lower to ſpeake of the excerciſes that euery ſouldier, and bande ought to doe perticularly, without which exerciſe, there may bee no ſeruice done (by theſe people thus choſen, armed, weaponed, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed into bands) in any good action; for they haue neede of more then all this.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Oraſmuch as the excerciſes wherein theſe new ſouldiers ſhould be practiſed are of diuers ſorts, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to ſpeake of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at length, would be too long a worke, I will ſpeake briefly of the moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieſt, which are theſe: as how to harden their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies vnto labours, to knowe how to vſe their armes, to keepe their order in paſſage through the countrie, &amp; at that time when they muſt fight, and how to lodg one of theſe Legions, or many togeather in a Campe, which in my iudgement are the chiefeſt poyntes that an armie ought to know. And therefore it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that the Souldiers ſhould be accuſtomed therein, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as they might poſſible, eſpecially vppon Sundays and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, wherein the Corporalls or Centeniers, Chiefes of ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, and Deceniers, muſt be diligent, &amp; muſt aſſemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with their people as often as they may. Alſo they ſhould be leuied ſo neare togeather, and thoſe that are companions, that the Corporals might aſſemble them togeather in ſhort time without great trouble or charge, to make them to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe to runne, to become ſwift to aſſault, to make them to bee actiue, as to throw the ſtone, dart, or barre of yron, and to wra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, to make them ſtrong, without which qualities, a Souldier can be worth nothing; becauſe that ſwiftneſſe doth make them ready, and able to endure trauell, to win a paſſage before an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, howe hard ſoeuer it bee to be gotten: it maketh them dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to ſurpriſe an enemie, when he doubteth it leaſt: and if an enemie doe flie, they wilbe the better able to ouertake him, if they bee actiue and nymble, they will the better beſtowe their blowes, and leape the lighter to paſſe a ditch, and mount the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier at a breatch, or vpon a ladder: their ſtrength will make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to beare the burthen of their armes the better, to ſtrike and force an enemie the more violenter, and to withſtand and reſiſt his
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:10495:29"/>
aſſaultes the more firmer. They muſt alſo be accuſtomed to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie heauie burthens, to the intent that if any voyage ſhould bee taken in hand, for the execution whereof, they ſhould be forced to iourney many dayes without victuales, they might carrie a good quantitie at their backes, for that Victuallers may not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be at their tayles: moreouer, if it ſhould be at any time requiſit for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to cary wood, yearth, or other thing to rampaire with all, it would be doubted that they could not doe it when it ſhoulde bee needefull, for lack of vſe. Furthermore, who ſo would not haue his people to bee hindred by any riuer, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing with them anie bridge or matter whereof to make one, ſhould cauſe them to practiſe to ſwime, for this exerciſe is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed amongſt the moſt neceſſarieſt. As for the other exerciſes, as to knowe how to handle the weapons which they doe carrie: euerie Decenier, Chiefe of Squadron, and Corporall, ought to be diligent to practiſe their men with ſword play: and thoſe that haue charge of Pikemen, ſhoulde practiſe them with the picke, and thoſe that haue the Halbardieres, and Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſieres in charge, muſt ſhew their Souldiers howe to helpe themſelues with their armes, and to carrie them well in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing of them. Theſe practiſes muſt bee exerciſed, the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers being armed, to the intent that through this cuſtome, they might eſteeme the waight of their harnes to be no heauier then the waight of their dublets: nor ſhould feele it more troubleſome vnto them, how long voyage ſoeuer they doe make, or how long ſoeuer they ſhould be armed. They muſt obſerue theſe things if they wilbe accompted good Souldiers, yet this is not ynough to make them to deſerue to bee called good Souldiers, albeit that they were as fit to labour, ſwift, actiue, and as wel practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as you could imagine: for it is neceſſarie that they ſhoulde learne how to raunge themſelues in ſingle order, and to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the voyces of the Captayne and Sergeants of the bands, to obey readely: alſo to know the ſignification of the ſounding of the Trumpet, and ſtroke of the Drumme, and to vſe theſe exerciſes willinglie and often. For (except this diſcipline be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently obſerued &amp; vſed almoſt euery day) theſe new men could doe no ſeruice ought worth, how hardie and couragious ſoeuer
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:10495:29"/>
they were: becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hardines without good order is much wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker then cowardlines well ordred, for that order doth chace away feare from mens hearts, &amp; diſorder doth plant it there, which ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hardly will come vpon theſe men, when they are inſtructed &amp; ordered as they ought to be, to wit, the ſouldiers of euery cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall together at the end of euery month: and the ſquadrons by turnes euery Sunday one: &amp; the Decens by turnes euery holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day one. And the bands ſhall aſſemble euery three months with their people &amp; officers each band a part: and the Legion twice a yeare. The Corporals ſhall aſſemble their Squadrons euery three moneths as is aforeſayd, &amp; ſhal bring their people vnto the place of méeting which the captaine ſhall appoint, where he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſhall be attendant to receiue his ſouldiors: to inſtruct them in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other points which they ought to know, to the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they do not find y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to be ſtrange to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which they ought to do in generall. For in the exerciſe of the warres, the greateſt ſtudie of all is, for the Souldiours to know what they ought to do in their particular bands, and what a bande ought to do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſembled with others in a Campe, for they that knowe the firſt, will eaſilie obſerue the ſecond: but not knowing the firſt, it is impoſſible that they ſhoulde attaine vnto the ſecond. Euery bande ought then to learne well by it ſelfe, how to keepe order in all kinds of moouings: as to martche ſlowly or haſtilye, and moreouer to learne all the ſounds, ſignes &amp; cries, by which they are commaunded in a battell, and that euerye man ſhould know their meaning, as thoſe that are in the Galleys do vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the blowing of the whiſtell: wherein theſe Souldiours ought to be ready and wiling to obeye incontinent, at the firſt ſtroke of the Drum, whether it be to marche forward, or to ſtay, or to turne backe againe, or to turne their faces and armes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards any part. And for this cauſe, the Colonell ought to giue order, that all his Drums ſhould ſtrike one ſtroke, and vſe one manner of ſounding in the field, whether it be to ſounde an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larme, or to make a Crye to put themſelues in battell: for to marche forward or backward, for to turne toward any part, and for a retreate, and in ſome, to ſignifie all thoſe other points with other Drums, which by the ſound of one Drum alone, cannot
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:10495:30"/>
ſo well be made knowne, as by manye: who make themſelues to be heard in the greateſt tumult and preaſes that may be. The Souldiers likewiſe ought to be ſo attentife to liſten vnto that which they are commaunded, that they ſhould neuer faile. The Drums ought alſo to bee readye to ſounde according vnto the ſound of the Colonel his Trumpet, by whome they muſt go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerne themſelues in all that they do. The Colonel his Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter ought to be expert in all his ſoundings, &amp; to handle them ſo clearly, that one thing be not miſtaken for an other: but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the Collonel his commaundement, as he ought to do, and to be alwayes attendant vpon him, and not to be from his hand. And to tell you the reaſons that make me to ordaine a Trumpet amongſt footmen, is, that it might bee better vnderſtoode in a great noyſe, then the Drums, or that when as the Drums ſhould alter their ſtroke, they might gouerne themſelues by the ſound of the Trumpet: whoſe ſounde is much lowder then the Drums, which the Switzers knowing, who are the inuenters of the Drums, do vſe Trumpets before their Bataillons, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their Chefes do ſignifie what the Batailon ought to doe: and it is not long ſince that they vſed great Hornes. All theſe ſmall things ought to be ſhewed vnto euery band a part, before that the Legion ſhould be aſſembled together, to the intent that they might know to keepe their order and ranks, that no force what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer might diſorder them: and that the ſound of the Trumpet might be ſo familiar vnto them, that they ſhould not erre, nor take one thing for another: but afterwards might eaſilie learne all that the Bataillon ought to doe, when they are aſſembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together. And foraſmuch as we put an armie into battell, eyther for that we ſee our enemies, or for that we doubt them, not ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them: euery bande ought to be practiſed and inſtructed in ſuch ſort, that it might marche vpon the waye ſurely, and fyght if need require, and euery Souldier to be taught what he ought to do, if they ſhould be aſſaulted vpon a ſudden. And when you do inſtruct them in the manner that they ought to keepe, to reſiſt their enemies vpon a day of Battell, it ſhalbe neceſſary to ſhew them how a battell dooth begim, and after what maner one Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talilon dooth encounter another of the enemies: and vnto what
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:10495:30"/>
place they muſt retire being repulſed, and who they are that ſhould put themſelues in their places; vnto what ſignes, ſounds and cryes they ought to obey: and what they ſhould doe when they heare thoſe ſoundes and cryes, and ſee thoſe ſignes: and to accuſtome them ſo well with thoſe fained battailes and aſſaults, that afterwards they ſhould not onely dare to abyde an enemie, but deſire the battaile: which bouldneſſe will rather proceede of the good order, and raunging that they doe finde to be in themſelues, then of their owne proper hardines: and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally becauſe their battailes ſhalbe ranged that the one may ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour the other eaſilie, which is a thing of no ſmall importance to imboulden Souldiors. For that if I be of the firſt battell that fighteth, and know vnto what place to retire when I am repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and who it is that ſhould come in my place, I ſhall alwaies fight with a better courage, ſeeing my ſuccour neare, then whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſee them not, or knowe not of them. Likewiſe, if I be of the ſecond battell (although the firſt be repulſed, and that I ſee them to giue backe) that ſhall nothing diſmaye me: becauſe I know before what that geuing backe doth ſignifie, but ſhall be more deſirous that it might be ſo, to the intent to be of that number that ſhould winne the victorye, and that the firſt ſhould not haue all the honour alone. Theſe exerciſes heere ſpoken of, are neceſſarye both for our new men, and for thoſe that are practiſed alſo: for we finde, that although the <hi>Romanes</hi> knew all that they ought to doe in a perticular bande, and alſo in an armie, and learned all thoſe pointes in their youthe: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they were practiſed aſwell in time of peace, as when their enemies were at hand. <hi>Ioſephus</hi> ſaythe in his Hiſtorie, that the continuall exerciſe of the <hi>Romanes</hi> armie, was cauſe that the multitude of thoſe that did follow the Campe, did ſerue vpon a day of battell aſwell as the men of war: for that they did know aſwell as the others to keepe their rankes, and to fight well. But for an hoaſt of new me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whether it be you leauie them to haue preſent ſeruice of them, or to haue ſeruice of them heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, it would be worth nothing without theſe exerciſes: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſithe that order is ſo neceſſary a thing, it muſt be ſhewed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them with double induſtrie and diligence, that vnderſtand it
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:10495:31"/>
not, and maintained in them that doe know it, as we finde that many excellent Captaines haue taken paines to teach &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine this diſcipline. But this matter hath brought me ſomwhat out of the way, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I doe ſpeake of the practiſing of the whole armie, before I haue declared how to exerciſe the bands parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, but it is the affection that I beare vnto this matter that is the cauſe; wherefore I will returne vnto my firſt purpoſe.</p>

I haue ſayd before that euery one of the ten bands that ſhalbe appointed for the bodie of the Battailion, of euery one of the newe Legions, which I doe ordaine (for I leaue a ſide the Legions heretofore leuied) ſhall haue 510. men, not coumpting the Captains: which 510. ought to be brought into 102. ranks, that is fiue men in euery ranke, and afterward their ranks aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented either marching ſlowly or in haſt: as of two rankes of fiue, to make one of ten, and of two of 10. to make one of 20. and ſoddainly to reduce them out of this ranke into their firſt ſingle order, and to aduertiſe them that the ſecond ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies follow the firſt, not leeſing them, and the third the ſecond: and the others likewiſe following vntil the laſt. This done you
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:10495:31"/>
may order euerie one of theſe bands, in that order that they muſt be ranged in, when al the Legion is in one Battailion together. And for to doe this, the Pikes for the flankes ſhalbe taken out of their order &amp; ſhalbe put one the one ſide: and two Corporalls of ordinary Pikes ſhall make the head, the one Corporall and his people firſt: and the other Corporall, and his people after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: and the Corporall of the Halbardiers ſhall followe them, with the Enſigne in the midſt of the Halberds. The other two Corporalls of ordinarie Pikes ſhall make the taile, eache one with his men: and they ſhalbe rancked fiue and fiue, and euerie Corporall muſt be ſhewed, what place he muſt keepe at al times: and the Corporalls muſt afterwards ſhew the Chiefes of ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, and the cheifes of ſquadrons, their Deceners. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine muſt be at the head of the band, and the Lieutenant at the taile. The Sergeant hath no place of abiding, except the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine doe giue him one: but muſt trot vp and downe from place to place, to make the ranks to keepe good order, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund that the Captaine willeth to be done. The Clarke of the band ſhalbe there alſo out of ranke to take view of thoſe that wante, that they might be puniſhed afterward, according vnto the lawes that the Colonell ſhall make for that purpoſe. The ſecond ranke ſhall enter with in the firſt: the fourth within the third: the ſixt within the fifte, and the other afterward follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo that the 85. ranks, which the fiue Corporalls with their Chiefs of Squadrons compriſed, doe come vnto 42. rankes, in euery one of which ranks are 10. men beſides their Corporals, which are ranged before their people. Theſe 42. rankes ſhalbe againe redoubled in making the on ranke to enter within the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as is a foreſaid: &amp; then wheras they were before but 10. me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they ſhal now be 20. with euery one of which ranks, their Chief of ſquadrons ſhall range themſelues in the midſt, ſo that he ſhall haue ten men vpon his right ſide, and ten vpon his left, which is a iuſt ſquadron. Euerie Corporall ſhall place himſelfe before his fower ſquadrons: ſo that the Souldiers of this one band, ſhall make 20. rankes: euerie one of which rankes ſhall haue 21. men. The firſt 8. rankes, and the laſt ſhalbe all Pikemen: and the fower in the midſt ſhalbe all Halbardiers.</p>

                     <p>Or otherwiſe all the ſouldiers of one Squadron might followe one another: and to make ſo many Squadrons as you intend to make rankes: For my meaning is that euerie Squadron ſhoulde make but one ranke. So that if they be ranked, fiue and fiue, and that you would range the 20. Squadrons in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, the Squadrons muſt be brought vp the one by the ſide of the other, vntill that they be all ranked the one nether before nor behinde the other. The firſt of euerie ranke ſhalbe the Chiefes of the Squadron, and the ſecond one of the two Diceneres; and after him all his Dicenere. The other Dicenere ſhalbe in the laſt ranke, and he ſhall ſerue for the guide behinde. His Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhalbe ioyned vnto his companions in ſuch order that the laſt of the one, and the laſt of the other, ſhall make the two mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle rankes. And as I did before place Halbardes in the midſt ſo I pretend heere alſo to haue as many, and theſe ſhalbe the laſt of euerie Dicenere that ſhall cary Halbards, and ſo there ſhalbe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:10495:32"/>
no expreſſe Squadrons of Halbards. By this reckoning there ſhalbe in this little Batailon 21. rankes of 20. men in front: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one of the Corporalls ſhall place himſelf before his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
                     <figure>

                     </figure>
                     <p>And whether the firſt maner be better then this or no, allwaies it is euident that the Souldiers ſhould be practiſed in ſuch ſort that they might know how to range themſelues in battaile: and muſt be made to martch haſtely forward and backwarde, and to paſſe through troubleſome paſſiages not looſing or breaking
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:10495:33"/>
their order: and if they can doe this they deſerue to bee called practiſed Souldiers, although that they neuer ſawe enemies and on the contrary parte, thoſe that cannot keepe theſe orders, although they had bin in a thouſand warres, ought to bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led but new ſouldiers. It is alſo a hard matter, for men to put themſelues ſuddainly into their firſt order, after that they are once broken either through ill paſſages, or by their enemies: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they haue had great exerciſe and long cuſtome. But to helpe them it weare neceſſarie to haue two things done, the one is, that the Enſignes might bee eaſely knowne, and that the Chiefes, Members, and officers ſhould haue ſome cogniſſance vpon their armes, or their garments, and the other is, that euery bande ſhoulde bee ranged in the Battaillion in one accuſtomed place, and not chaunge at any time: and that the Corporalls ſhould know their places with their troups, not altering at any time: ſo that if a Corporall were accuſtomed to bee in the firſt ranke, hee ſhoulde allwaies continew there: in the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted them at the beginning. And if a band bee accuſtomed to be on the right ſide it ſhoulde there continew, and that on the left ſide likewiſe in his place. By this meanes if the Souldiers weare accoſtomed to knowe their places (put caſe that they ſhould be out of order) they would quickly bring themſelues in againe: for the Enſigns knowing their accuſtomed places in the Battaillion, &amp; the Corporalls knowing euerie one their place, might ſoone ſee where they ought to range: for thoſe of the frunt would retyre vnto the frunt, and thoſe of the taile vnto their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces alſo. Moreouer the Chiefes of Squadrons doe knowe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to how many rankes they ſhould range themſelues, and aſwell they as the Corporals doe knowe who ſhoulde goe before, and who ſhould followe. Wherefore the Souldiers hauing nothing to doe but to follow their Chiefes, woulde range themſelues readily euery one in his place, without Sergeant or any other to place them: for that the cuſtome would make them perfect. Thſe thinges heare ſpoken of doe teache themſelues, ſo that there be diligence vſed and cuſtome: and after that they are once well learned they will be hardly forgotten. It ſhalbe alſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to make them to turne all at once: for ſomtime the head
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:10495:33"/>
muſt be made the tayle, or one of the flanks, according vnto the enimie his force, and the place he will aſſault them on, and for to anſwer on that ſide that ſhall be neceſſarie, there needes no more but to turne their faces, and that part that they turne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſhall be called the front. But who ſo would that a whole Bataillon ſhould turne all together, as if it were a maſſie body, muſt haue therein great practiſe and diſcretion: for as if they ſhould turne toward the left hand, thoſe of the left corner ſhould ſtand ſtill, and thoſe next them muſt go but ſlowly, that thoſe in the right corner ſhould not be conſtrained to run, or els all would come to a confuſion: but this may better be ſhewed by effect, then by writing. As for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two bands y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhould make the forlorne hope, their Pikemen may be ranged in battell, to learne them to keepe order: for I would vſe them, and thoſe of the flankes in particular factions, to wit in ſkirmiſhes, and other extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſeruice, where it ſhould not be needfull to ſend any great number of people, but principally I will haue thoſe of the flanks to defend and couer the Bataillon: and as for the forlorne hope, I appoint them both Pikes and Harquebuſiers to begin the Battell, and to fight amongſt the Horſſemen, without keeping any order. And to that intent I haue armed them lightlye, for their office ſhallbe to fight not ſtanding firme, but running from one place to another, be it y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they haue the enimie in chaſe, or are chaſed themſelues, wherein the Pikes may doe great ſeruice: for they may reſkue the Harquebuſiers, and may ſhew their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vnto thoſe that would force them, whether they were on Horſebacke or a foote, or to follow thoſe that ſhould flye, and to force thoſe that ſhrinke. So that as well the one as the other, whether they be of the body of the Bataillon, or of the flanks, or of the forlorne hope, haue need to be well exerciſed, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that they might knowe how to keepe their ranks, and to put themſelues readilye againe into their places if they were broken, by meanes of ill and ſtraight paſſage, or that the enemy ſhould put them into any diſorder: and if they can doo this in their particular bands, euery band wil afterwards eaſily learne what place it ought to keepe in the Bataillon, and alſo what they ought to do in a Campe. As for the bands of theſe legions
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:10495:34"/>
that are already made in <hi>France,</hi> which are of a 1000 men, to bring them into order: fyrſt make their ſingle order of 6 and 6, and afterwards reduce the ſix Corporals men, which are for the bodie of the Batailon into 96 rankes, not comprehending the Corporals, nor the Chiefes of Squadrons; then double them, and make them of 12 in a ranke, cauſing the one ranke to enter within the other as is aboueſaid, ſo that the 96 rankes ſhall come vnto 48. Moreouer, they muſt be doubled againe, and from 12 in a ranke they will amount vnto 24. and the Cheife of the Squadron ſhall ioyne with them, ſo that euery ranke will be 25 men. The Corporals ſhall put themſelues before their Squadrons, euery man before his owne, two Corporals of Pikemen ſhall make the forepart of this ſmall Battailon: and two Corporals of Halbardiers ſhall make the middeſt, and hee that is formoſt of them, ſhall make one ranke of Halbardiers, and then two ranks of Pikes, and after them one ranke of Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardiers. The other corporall that is behind him ſhall alſo make one ranke of Halbardiers: then 2. rankes of Pikes, &amp; after them one ranke of Halbardiers: by which accoumpt there ſhall be 2. rankes of Halbardiers together in the middeſt, &amp; the Enſigne in the midſt of them. The other two Corporals ſhall make the taile of this Batailon, and each of their troopes ſhall make foure rankes. Touching the other foure Corporals, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, one muſt be appointed for the flanke, and the other three for the forlorne hope. And this is the forme that I would keepe in ranging one of the bands of theſe Legions by it ſelfe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Souldiers muſt be often practiſed.</p>

                     <p>And if the King would permit that theſe orders, ſhould be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently executed, and put in practiſe, he ſhould haue many good Souldiers in his kingdome in ſhort time, but the diſorder that is amongſt our men of warre at this preſent, is cauſe that theſe things are diſpraiſed; and therfore our armies can not be good: albeit that the Chiefes were naturally vertuous, for that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill followed and obeyed, can neither ſhewe their knowledge nor their vertue. It may bee alſo that the number of Chiefes which I doe ordaine in a Legion, ſhoulde ſeeme ſuperfluous, or might make a confuſion amongſt themſelues: becauſe of the number which I doe inſtitute, which thing would be to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, except they ſhould referre themſelues wholly vnto one
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:10495:35"/>
Chiefe: but hauing one principall Cheife aboue them all, the great nomber of officers wil cauſe good order: for if there ſhould not be a great number of Cheifes, it would be impoſſible to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne ſo great a multitude of people: for as a wall that ouer hangeth, doth require rather to be vpholden with many ſhoores, although they bee not very ſtrong, then with a fewe of greate ſtrength: for that one alone, how ſtrong ſoeuer it bee cannot aſſure the wall but onely where it ſtandeth; ſo likewiſe muſt it be in a Legion, for it is neceſſarie that among euery ten men there ſhould be one of more courage or at leaſt of greater autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie then the reſt, to keepe the other Souldiers firme and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to fight, through their good courage, examples, words, and authoritie: ſpecially the Deceniers are neceſſarie, if they did but ſerue to keepe the rankes right and firme, and in ſo doeing, it were impoſſible that the Souldiers ſhoulde diſorder them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and if ſo bee that they ſhoulde bee ſo far put out of order, that they coulde not immediatly finde their places, by meanes of theſe Chiefes, who ſhoulde haue regard therevnto being by them, the Chiefes of the Squadrons are to commaunde the Deceniers, and the Corporalls are aboue them: who looke into al things that doeth concerne the duety of the Souldiers and theirs. But at this day wee ſerue our ſelues with all theſe offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, to no other effect but to giue them more wages then vnto other men: for that they haue credit to bring certaine compag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions vnto the bands, which is cauſe of many Leagues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Souldiers. We vſe likewiſe Enſignes at this preſent, more to make a great ſhew, then for any militarie vſe: our aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetours did vſe them for guides, and to knowe how to bring themſelues into order by them: for euerie man after the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne was placed, knew his place by it, and placed himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent, they knew alſo that if it mooued or ſtayed they ought to mooue or to ſtay. Wherefore it is neceſſarie, that in an hoaſt there ſhould bee many bodies, that is to ſay bands, and that euerie body ſhould haue an Enſigne to conduct thoſe that are of the ſame body: and ſo the hoaſt ſhall haue many ſoules, and by conſequent many liues. The Souldiers ought then to gouerne themſelues by their Enſignes, and the Enſignes by the ſound of the Drume, which being well ordered as it ought
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:10495:35"/>
to be, doth commaund a whole Legion, which Legion march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuch ſort, that the ſteppes of the Souldiers do agree with the ſtroke of the Drumme, ſhall eaſily keepe their order. And for this purpoſe had the auncient Souldiers Flutes &amp; Phiphes perfectly agreeing with the ſound of their Drummes: for as he that daunceth according vnto the ſteppes of his muſicke, doth not erre; ſo likewiſe a Battell in marching according to the ſound of the Drumme, can neuer put it ſelfe in diſorder. And therefore when they would chaunge their gate, or would encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and appeaſe their Souldiers, they chaunged their ſound; and as the ſounds were variable, ſo likewiſe their names were differing: for they had the <hi>Orique</hi> ſtroke, and the <hi>Phrigian</hi> ſtroke; the one animated the Souldiers, and the other appeaſed them. They had beſides many other; as the <hi>Aeolian, Iaſian, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> and others: all which ſerued to appeaſe and to inflame the hearts of men. We haue in our time Drummes for footmen, and Trumpets for horſemen: either of them hath ſtrokes and ſounds to reuiue Souldiers when neede requireth, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented to the intent that they might commaund, and bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood a farre of. But I beleeue that Drummes were inuented for a meaſure for Souldiers to march by, for all the times of their ſtrokes are true ſtoppes and meaſures, for to haſten and ſlake the goings of men of warre. Now, when as the Bands are inſtructed in the exerciſes which they ought to knowe perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, and therein haue many times béen exerciſed, it is time to put them into the feeld, in ſome place where the Legion might meete moſt commodiouſly. In which place all the Captaines ſhall meet at the day appoynted, euery man bringing his band with him, and as little carriage as poſſiblie he may, &amp; the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines themſelues muſt leſſen their eſtate, if they were accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to carrie any tayle. Moreouer, they muſt haue a regard that the Corporalls, Chiefes of Squadrons, and Deceniers, do not mount on horſebacke, nor likewiſe the ſimple Souldiers. The Captaine &amp; his members muſt forbeare riding as much as may bee, I do not meane that if he had any ſicke men that they ſhould not ride; but all others: for ſith they haue taken the eſtate of footmen vpon them, it is neceſſarie that they ſhould execute it
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:10495:36"/>
wholly. And as for the carrying of their baggage, one horſe ſhall ſuffice for a ſquadron, which ſhal carrie two Mattreſſes of courſe canuas, two couerings, &amp; one tent for the one Deciene, and as much for the other, with ſome linnen, pots, and veſſell, &amp; tooles to make Trenches and Bulwarkes, and alſo a ladder of good length made of peeces. Euery Deciene may haue a ſeruant; the Chiefe of Squadron one, and the Corporall two. The Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and his foure Chiefs of Squadron ſhall haue a Tent and a horſe to carrie it. The Captaine ſhall bring with him as fewe horſes and ſeruaunts as poſſiblie he may. The Lieutenant and Enſigne bearer may haue either of them two, euery officer one, &amp; the Drummers ſhall haue none: but they muſt be lodged néere vnto the Captaine, and his members. The Colonell and the Officers of the Legion, ſhall keepe as fewe as they may: for of a great baggage procéedeth oftimes many diſorders, and the ruine of an armie: and aſwell the horſes as the ſeruants ſhould bee choſen to bee ſuch, as might ſerue more then one turne at a neede: and aboue all things there muſt be none ſuffered to carrie Trunckes, Coffers, Waggons, nor Whores. And in this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, all the bands of the Legion will be the better giuen to do all honeſt exerciſes, then if they ſhould bee troubled with all theſe lets. Moreouer, the whole Legion will paſſe foure daies for a need, with the victualls that the whores, pages, and horſe, that one of the bands that are now ordayned do carrie with them, do conſume in one day. Hauing ſo prouided for the baggage, the Captaines ſhall put themſelues into the feeld euery one a part with his companie, and ſhall go towards the place where the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall muſter is appoynted to bee kept, making ſmall iournies, and in the beſt order that they can, finding their Souldiers to bee good and honeſt men. And to bee ſo thought of, they ſhall march through the countrie in good order ſounding their Drum, and not in troope as vanquiſhed men, and ſhal lodge themſelues without the townes.</p>

This length may be deuided without breaking any ground: for it will ſerue the turne to line it out with cordes, without making ditch or other thing, but only placing the bands euery one in his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But if the Campe might bee inuironed with a ſmall trench, ſuch as is vſed in the countrie where it doth lodge, to keepe the ſame forme that it ſhould do if an enemie were neere, it would be better. There muſt alſo a night watch bee ſet, and aboue all things regard had of ſurpriſe, as carefully as if it were in time of warre; and in the morning there muſt be a diſcouerie made, before that the watch bee diſcharged, and afterward they muſt diſlodge altogether: but before they depart, the Captaine muſt cauſe all thoſe to bee ſatiſfied that haue furniſhed his Souldiers with victuall, or other thing; that it be not ſayd that they tooke any thing not paying for it, or without the good willes of the people of the countrie: but that they and their Souldiers ſhould gouerne themſelues euery where ſo orderly, that the countrie ſhould not feele that there had any band paſſed. And in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they ſhall go towards the place where the muſter ſhall bee kept, behauing themſelues like honeſt men, and good Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: and when they approach neere vnto the ſayd place, the harbinger ſhall go before to ſeeke for the quarter where the band ſhall lodge in the Campe, the Legion being aſſembled and lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged together, who muſt repayre vnto the maiſter of the Campe of the ſayd Legion, whoſe office amongſt other things, is to chooſe the moſt wholeſomeſt place to lodge the ſayd Legion in Campe that he can finde. And hauing found ſome commodious
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:10495:37"/>
place, he muſt lay out the quarters, and appoynt in what order the Campe ſhould be fortified: and therefore it ſhall bee neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie that the maiſter of the Campe ſhould go before for to deuide and lay out all the quarters before the bandes ſhould ariue, where it is ment that they ſhould lodge. The Colonell ſhall be attendant in the ſayd place, to ſee the bands come in order, and the Prouoſt ought to bee abroade to vnderſtand of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers miſdemeanour, or of any other vnder their colour, to the intent to puniſh thoſe that do commit any offence. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, certaine men muſt bee appoynted to followe after the bands foote by foote, who ſhould looke into their behauiour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the countrie, and ſhall informe the Colonell of all that paſſeth. And if there be any complaint, the Colonell ſhall lay it vpon the Captaine his necke of the band that hath committed the offence, if ſo bée that the fault was committed through his negligence, or that he vſed no induſtrie to puniſh the offenders: then he ſhould bee houlden to make ſatiſfaction of his owne purſe, if it were any thing that might bée recompenced with monie; and if it were any fault that deſerued bodily puniſhment, the ſayd Captaine ſhould bee driuen to ſeeke out the offender, and to deliuer him into the Prouoſts hands: and if he were fled, the purſuite after him ſhould be made at the Captaines charge: for by the meanes of this rigour, the Captaines would looke very néere vnto their people, and would bée more diligent to make them to liue honeſtly, or to puniſh them more greeuouſly then they are.</p>
                     <p>But wée muſt lodge the bands as they ariue, and ſpeake of the forme of the Campe that ſhall lodge the whole Legion. Then for to lodge the twelue bands, putting them in one Campe together, wée muſt chooſe a ſquare place of ſixe hundred and ſixtie paces in length, and aſmuch in breadth: in the middeſt of which great ſquare ſhall bee a leſſer ſquare made, which ſhall bée euery way fourtie paces; within which ſquare muſt the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell bee placed, for he muſt keepe the Campe aſwell as his Souldiers: and I would inuiron this ſayd ſquare with a ſmall trench, within which trench I would lodge the maiſter of the Campe, the Prouoſt, the other officers of the Legion, and the

Colonell his guard. And thoſe that followe the Colonell for their pleaſures, hauing no charge, I would lodge them without round about the ſayd trench. And for to order the reſt well, I would appoynt that the front of the Campe ſhould bee toward the Eaſt, and the backe towards the Weſt, and the flanckes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the other two Regions. For to deuide the quarters, ſtretch a line from the Colonell his lodging Eaſt-ward, which muſt be three hundred and ten paces long, &amp; afterwards ſtretch two other lines of either ſide of it one, which muſt be of the ſame length that the firſt was, each of them thirtie paces diſtant from it, to the intent that the breadth of this ſpace may be fourtie pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. At the ende of theſe lines I would make a barre or gate, which I would name the Eaſt-gate: the diſtance betwixt theſe two outtermoſt lines will make a fayre ſtreate, to go from the Colonell his quarter out of the Campe, which ſtreate will bée threeſcore paces broad, as is aforeſayd. On the other ſide of the Colonell his quarter Weſt-ward, muſt three other lines bée ſtretched of like length and diſtance, as the three firſt aforeſayd: ſo likewiſe vpon the South and North ſides ſhall be two other ſtreates made of like length and breadth. I make all theſe ſtreates ſo broad, to the intent to lodge in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all ſorts of buyers and ſellers, artificers, and victualers that do followe the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Furthermore, I do make foure ſquare places, betwixt theſe foure ſtreates, euery one of which places ſhall containe two hundred and fourtie paces in length, and aſmuch in breadth. The Campe ſhalbe incloſed with a trench, betwixt which trench and the quarters for the lodgings ſhall be a ſpace left of three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore paces broad round about, which ſhall not be occupied with any lodging, but ſhall be emptie to ſerue to ſet the watch, and to raunge the Legion in battell, if neede were. As for the foure pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces aboueſayd, thoſe two that are betwixt the Eaſt and North ſtreates, and betwixt the South and Weſt ſtreates, ſhall ſerue to lodge the twelue Bands: to wéet, ſixe in one quarter, and ſixe in another. Each of theſe two quarters ſhall bée deuided into ſixe parts, euery one of which parts ſhall bée two hundred and fourtie paces in length, and fiue and thirtie paces in breadth, and euery one of theſe parts ſhall bée furthermore deuided into
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:10495:38"/>
ſeauen parts, as I haue ſayd before in the lodging of a Band a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. Betwixt the quarters of euery two Bands there ſhall be a way left of ſixe paces large, which ſhall ſerue for to come and go vnto the perticular quarters: the other two parts which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine vndeuided, ſhall by and by bee ſet a worke: but for the twelue Bands this is ſufficient. So that after this, or ſome bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter manner, may euery Legion be lodged as often as it ſhall be aſſembled to make a generall muſter.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Oraſmuch as the <hi>Romanes</hi> in all their leuies of footmen, haue alwaies incorporated certaine number of horſemen with them, and that their perfect Legions conſiſted of theſe two manner of Souldiers; I thinke it alſo conuenient to ioyne ſome horſemen vnto the leuie of theſe newe Legionaries, which horſemen ſhould bée incorporated with the Legions, and ſhould bee with them at the generall muſters, to exerciſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues together, and to learne the ſcience of the warres one with another: for except that they ſhould ioyntly practiſe themſelues, it would not be poſſible that any one of theſe two ſorts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould do good ſeruice: foraſmuch as they both do make but one whole bodie, which ought to bee ſo compounded, that either of them ſhould do ſeruice in their due time, and conſequently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery part of them. And if ſo be that this were done, you ſhal find that one intier Legion ſhall do more ſeruice then three other Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions accompanied with a multitude of horſemen, whoſe foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and horſemen do not vnderſtand one another. Therefore it would not bee amiſſe that the King ſhould ordaine, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of his ordinarie companies of horſemen ſhould bee ioyned with theſe Legions, and be with them at the general muſter: and that there ſhould bee two Bands incorporated with euery Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, each of which Bands ſhould haue 100. men of armes, one hundred light Horſemen, fiftie Hargoletiers or Scoutes,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:10495:39"/>
and fiftie Harquebuziers. And if they were companies that the king did newly take vp, the moſt modeſt and moſt expert men ſhould bée choſen for men of armes: and afterwards the other muſt bee preferred from degree to degree, accompting the light Horſemen before the Hargoletiers, and the Hargoletiers before the Harquebuziers; ſo that the Harquebuziers are the worſt of theſe foure ſortes of Horſemen. There muſt alſo a regard bée had vnto the errour that is committed at this day among our ordinarie bands: which is, that young men are made men of armes, which are but newly come from being pages, or from ſchoole. But for to haue theſe companies in better order the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they now are, it ſhould bee neceſſarie to make an order, by which all young men aboue ſeauentéene yeare olde that would bee of the bandes of the Horſemen (not excepting one) vnleſſe he were a Prince, ſhould bee conſtrayned firſt to bee Harquebuziers two or three yeares, and afterwards they ſhould be Hargoletiers as long, and after that light Horſemen: amongſt which three ſorts they might learne thoſe things that were neceſſarie for euery good horſemen to knowe; and that before their departing from them they might paſſe the furie and fire of their youth, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come colde and modeſt to gouerne themſelues wiſely amongſt men of armes, with whome they ſhould bee conſtrayned to ſerue the ſpace of three or foure yeares without diſcharging, and that time being expired, if they were bound to finde a man of armes by the tenour of their lands, they ſhould then bee exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the ordinarie bands, and goe home vnto their owne houſes, to bee readie as often as they ſhould be commaunded. This rule ought generally to be kept, with all thoſe that ſhould employ themſelues among the ordinarie bands, although they were of greater age: for otherwiſe the ſeruice of the <hi>Rierban,</hi> which the gentlemen of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> do owe vnto the King, would in ſhort ſpace come to nothing: which at this inſtant, as may be ſeene, is brought into very lowe eſtate. And the reaſon is, that euery man will bee of the ordinarie bands of men of armes, to be excuſed from the <hi>Rierban;</hi> ſo that the gouernours that were wont to make fiue or ſixe hundred men of armes of the <hi>Rier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi> can hardly now bring one hundred together: and thoſe
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:10495:39"/>
alſo if they ſhould come to the muſter, would be ſo ill furniſhed, that it is a mockery to ſée them in ſo poore eſtate. But may this ſeruice be had in more contempt? when as thoſe which are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to this dutie, and which do not excuſe themſelues by the ordinarie Bands, exempt their owne perſons, and ſend ſome ſeruant in their places, whereas héeretofore all the principall of <hi>Fraunce</hi> thought it a great honor for them to be there in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: notwithſtanding at this inſtant, not only the greater ſort, but the leſſer would thinke to be diſhonored, if they ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare at the Muſter. And therefore thoſe that are bound vnto this ſeruice, do put themſelues into the ordinarie bands, to be frée of the <hi>Rierban:</hi> and as they cannot all be there, ſo it is alſo that the greateſt part do finde ſome excuſe to exempt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: and if ſo be that their excuſe be not receiuable, they will then come ſo euill furniſhed, and with ſo ill a will, that it is impoſſible that they ſhould do the King good ſeruice, which is an occaſion that the Nobilitie is no more eſtéemed as it was wont to be: but if ſo be it were mainteined as it hath béen in times paſt, it is certaine that we ſhould be mutch more feared of our enemyes then we now are: moreouer, the King ſhould not be charged with the mainteining of ſo many Horſſemen as he is, but might diſcharge more then the one halfe of his ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Bands, to conuert that money, for the maintenance of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne ordinarie Bands of footemen. Moreouer, the King ſhould compell hys Nobilitie to furniſh themſelues better for the warres then they are: and forbid them rather their pompe, then to ſuffer a Gentleman of <hi>Fraunce</hi> to be an ill horſſeman, ill armed, and ill practiſed: and to that end ſhould ordaine, that the <hi>Rierban</hi> ſhould muſter in armes twice a yeare at the leaſt: and there ſhould be certaine ſeueare men appointed to take the view of thoſe Muſters, who ought to let none paſſe, but the perſons themſelues which are bound to this ſeruice, except they were Magiſtrates, or ſicke men, for they are excuſable, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally the Magiſtrates. But for the ſicke men, although they be exempted for their perſons, yet muſt they ſhew their furniture, and for default thereof, their lands ſhould be ſeazed vpon imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly, as well as theirs that are in health, and do not appeare,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:10495:40"/>
or as thoſe that do appeare not mounted, or furniſhed in armes, according to their charge. Moreouer, it ſhould be neceſſary to puniſh all thoſe that are not practiſed, ſo that they might be an example vnto all thoſe that are negligent to mount, arme, &amp; to practice themſelues as they ought to do: this doing, the King ſhould reſtore his Nobilitie, &amp; make an excellent Chiualrie. And to the intent y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gentlemen ſhould not excuſe themſelus through the great dearth that we haue of Horſſe in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> the King ſhould cauſe ſome good &amp; faire broode of Horſſes &amp; Mares to be brought fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other Countreys, and afterwards diſtribute them vnto the Prelats, &amp; Gouernours, &amp; vnto men of great Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to haue a great brood within the Realme, whereof the ſaid Prelats &amp; their ſucceſſors ſhould be bound to giue an accoumpt yearely, &amp; to cauſe the ſaid Mares to be ordered &amp; cheriſhed as they ought to be, and their Colts to be managed at their owne proper charges; by this means I would not doubt to ſée <hi>France</hi> in ſhort time better furniſhed with Horſſe, then any neighbour ſhe hath, beſides, their maintenance ſhould coſt the King no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: and it would be an occaſion that the ſaid Prelats ſhould do the common wealth of <hi>Fraunce</hi> ſome ſeruice, whereas at this day they do ſtand it but in little ſtead (I meane thoſe that are buſie with the world, and not with the Church) and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the King would purſſe vp again the money that the Mares and Stallions had coſt him, he might do it, giuing the beſt Horſſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> might be taken out of the <hi>Raunges</hi> vnto his men of armes ill mounted, rebating it vpon their wages, cauſing the reſt to be ſould: and to find buiers, he might ordaine, that no man of what condition ſoeuer he were, ſhould kéep Moyle, Sumpter-horſſe, or Hackney, if he kéepe not likewiſe a good Horſſe, or if he kept but one Horſſe to ride vpon, the ſame might be fit for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> warres. Moreouer, it might be forbidden that no man ſhould wear ſilke, except he kept a good Horſſe. And in mine opinion, the number of thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> deſire to be ritchly clad, is ſo great, that I knowe not if there would be horſſes found inough in 6. realmes for to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: wherefore there is no doubt to be made, but that there would be buiers inow, how great aboundance ſoeuer ther were of horſſes: beſides, the <hi>Rierban</hi> would néede a great many, ſo that if theſe things had place, and furthermore that it were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:10495:40"/>
euery man to kéep a brood that would, we ſhould ſée horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſould ſo good cheape in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> that we might haue more reaſon to thinke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rather to be giuen then ſould; which would be an occaſion that the men of armes (which dare not abandon nor hazard the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in places where their Horſſes may either be ſlaine or loſt, more then they néeds muſt, ſéeing them to be ſo ill to be recouered) would put on their ould vertue, &amp; ſhew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be others then at this day they are eſtéemed to be, and it would make me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be better cheape then the horſes are at this inſtant. Moreouer, if the King would that his horſſemen ſhould make leſſe accompt of their liues, and haue horſſes better cheap then if they ſhould buy them, he might furniſh them at the firſt, &amp; as often as they lack horſſes, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their horſſes were ſlaine in fight, or loſt by any inconuenient, &amp; not through their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault; for in this caſe they ſhould be bound to put ſo many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in their places, and to giue an accompt of them at theyr muſter: and if ſo be that they would diſcharge themſelues, or y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhould be diſcharged, they ſhould then be bound to reſtore the horſes which the King had giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if they were aliue, and hauing loſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through their owne negligence, they ſhould be bound to buy others in their places, as good as they were. The like alſo ſhould be done whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Harquebuſiers ſhould become Hargoletiers, or the Hargoletiers light horſemen, &amp; light horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men men of armes, that euery man ſhould leaue the horſſe that had bin deliuered to him by the King, vnto him that ſhould ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede in his place: for I ſuppoſe that a man of armes hath neede of a ſtronger horſſe then a light horſeman, and a light horſeman a ſtronger then a hargoletier, and a hargoletier ſtronger then a harquebuſier. And therfore there ought to be broods of diuers ſorts of horſſes, as Courſers of <hi>Naples</hi> &amp; of <hi>Flanders</hi> for men of armes, and <hi>Turks, Valacks, Polacks, Coruaks,</hi> and horſſe of <hi>Spaine</hi> for light horſſemen, <hi>Barbares, Moores,</hi> &amp; ſmall horſſes of <hi>Spayne</hi> for Hargoletiers, and the leaſt might be choſen out of all theſe for the harquebuſiers, ſo that they were light and quick. But this tale hath laited long inough, let vs therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto the <hi>Rierbans,</hi> &amp; let vs ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in their goings &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their muſters, they would begger y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people, if they were ſuffered to liue at their own diſcretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and to kéepe
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:10495:41"/>
the féeld without paiment, as they do at this preſent. In conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration whereof, it ſhould be neceſſary to ordaine that theyr charges ſhould be borne by the Nobilitie, &amp; not by the common people: and that the muſters ſhould ſometimes be made in the midſt of the Prouinces, ſometime in one place, and ſometime in another, ſo that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gentlemen who are far from the place where the muſter is kept at one time, might be neerer at another, to the intent that no man ſhould be more charged, nor eaſed then other. But this is not that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I would ſpeake of, yet I thought good to touch it in paſſing. But to returne vnto that I ſpake of yong men, that they ſhould be harquebuſiers a horſſebacke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they attaine to be Hargoletiers, and be Hargoletiers before that they become light horſſemen, and ſhould ſpend ſome time in theſe thrée eſtates, before they ſhould attaine to be men of armes. And to ſpeake ſomewhat of thoſe that do finde this tearme to be too long, and to take away all hope from them that would thinke to come vnto this laſt eſtate by fauour or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, except it be that their turnes do come, or that they ſhould be aduanced for ſome vertuous acte: I am of opinion that none ſhould leape from the one of theſe eſtates vnto another, but that he ſhould follow them one after another their full time, or elſe that he ſhould neuer attaine to any charge, nor beare office a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of armes, nor likewiſe haue any other eſtate, or royall office, ſo that the Gentlemen ſhould kéepe themſelus to ſerue in the <hi>Rierban,</hi> and of this order would many proffits proceede, for firſt of all yong men would giue themſelues more vnto the exerciſe of armes then they do: moreouer, the bands would be filled with better men then they are at this day, and there would be no man in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ordinary bands, who were mounted to the eſtate of a man of armes, but he ſhould be able to gouerne a good charge; and therefore it would be a rich treaſure to haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of horſſemen in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> whoſe men of armes were able to conduct themſelues and others. Finally, the offices &amp; eſtates appertaining vnto the warres, as Stewardſhips, Prouoſts, Maiors, Caſtellins, &amp; other offices of commaundement, which are in the Kings gift, ſhould be mutch better imployed vppon theſe men, and be better executed by them, then they may be by
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:10495:41"/>
thoſe that neuer ſaw any thing, or that had neuer done him ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. But let vs paſſe further, the hundred men of armes, and the other horſſemen diſtributed as is aforeſaid, ſhould be put vnder the charge of a Captaine, who ſhould haue vnder him a Lieutenant, an Enſigne bearer, and a Guydon (as we haue at this inſtant) the men of armes ſhould follow the Enſigne, and the light horſſe, hargoletiers, &amp; harquebuſiers, ſhould follow the Guidon: theſe four Chiefes, or members, ſhould be more then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 100. men of armes. Moreouer, they muſt haue a Marſhall to lodge them, &amp; to deuide their quarters. They muſt haue alſo 2. harbingers, &amp; certaine Trompets ouer and aboue this number. And as I haue appointed amongſt the footemen certaine perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Chiefs, ſo alſo there muſt be ſome appointed amongſt the horſſemen, but not of ſo many ſorts: for it will ſuffice that the horſſemen ſhould haue ouer euery nine a Chiefe, who ſhalbe the tenth man, &amp; ſhall be called the <hi>Decurion.</hi> Furthermore, there ſhall be a Chiefe ouer the Hargoletiers, and another ouer the Harquebuſiers, who ſhalbe called by the name of <hi>Benderal,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>Italians</hi> do vnderſtand by this word their Enſigne bearers, for I will help my ſelf with this tearme, to ſignifie the Chiefes of theſe ſmall bands, who likewiſe may be called Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductors, and they ſhalbe ouer and aboue their number, &amp; vnder the charge of the Captaine, and of his members, and officers as well as the others. Wherefore in a company of legionarie men of armes, there ſhalbe 309. horſſemen, beſides the Trompets; euery one of theſe horſſemen ſhall be armed according vnto his charge: for the men of armes ſhall be better armed then the light horſſemen: and the light horſſemen better then the Hargoletiers or harquebuſiers. Firſt of all the men of armes ſhall be armed with ſoulleretz, whole grefues, cuiſſes, curets with taſſes, gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, pouldrons, vambraces, gauntlets, helmet with beuer, goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets, &amp; great pieces: all which I haue ſpecified perticularly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the men of armes at this preſent, who will be called me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of armes, and notwithſtanding are armed and furniſhed but like vnto light horſſemen: and you knowe that a man that is armed light, ſhall neuer do the effect that a man may do that is well ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, who can not be hurt by hand-ſtrokes, where as the light horſſeman is ſubiect vnto blowes vpon many parts of his body,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:10495:42"/>
becauſe that his harneſſe is not ſo heauie, nor ſo ſure as the men of armes ought for to be, and not without cauſe, for the paines that a light horſſeman and other light armed ought to take, there is no man able to indure with a complet harneſſe, nor horſſe able to carry him: but as for the men of armes, who are appointed to abide firmely the aſſaults of their enemies, and not to runne from the one ſide to the other, may be laden with heauie harneſſe; and to carry ſutch a waight, they ought to haue ſtrong and great horſſes, for beſides this, the horſſes muſt be barbed. Theſe men of armes ought to haue arming ſwords by their ſides, a maſe hanging at their ſaddle pomell: their launces muſt be ſtrong and of a reaſonable length, their coates muſt be of the collour of their Enſigne, the which as alſo the <hi>Guidon,</hi> ought to be of the ſame collour that the Enſignes of the foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the ſame Legion are. The light horſſemen muſt be good ſouldiers, and armed with curets, &amp; taſſes that ſhall reach to the knée, with gauntlets, vambraces, and large pouldrons, and with a ſtrong and cloſe head-péece, the ſight being cut; their caſſaks ſhall be of the collour of their Enſigne: they muſt carry a broad ſword by their ſides, a maſe at the pomels of their ſaddle, and a launce of good length in their fiſt. The Hargoletiers ſhall be armed like vnto the light horſemen, ſauing vpon their armes; in ſtead of vambraces and gauntlets, they ſhall haue ſléeues and gloues of male, a broade ſword by their ſides, their maſes at the pomels of their ſadles, &amp; a Iaueline in their hands of 10. or 12. foote long, headed at both ends with a ſharpe head, or may carry a launce as the others: their garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts vpon their harneſſe ought to be very ſhort, without ſléeues, and of the collour aboueſaid. Theſe hargoletiers may ſerue for ſkirmiſhes, &amp; may do great murdre with their Iauelins among vnarmed men &amp; horſſes, &amp; when as they would ſet foot on ground, they might do the ſame ſeruice that Pikemen do: and if they do carry launces, they may vſe them as others do. The harquebuſiers ſhall likewiſe be well mounted, &amp; their armour ſhalbe like vnto the Hargoletiers, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the head-péece: for they only ſhal haue Murrions, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſée the better round about them, &amp; to haue their heads at more liberty, a ſword by their ſides, a maſe at the pomell of their ſaddles on the one ſide, and a harquebuſſe in a caſe of leather on
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:10495:42"/>
the other, which muſt be made faſt that it ſtirre not: which har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuſſe may be 2. foote and a halfe, or 3. foote long, or rather more ſo it be light: their coates ſhalbe of the ſame faſhion and collour that the Hargoletiers are. The harquebuſiers wages in time of peace, may be 3. crownes a month, the hargoletiers 4. the light horſemen 5. and the men of armes 7. The <hi>Decurions</hi> of men of armes ought to haue ſomewhat more wages then a ſimple man of armes, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>Decurions</hi> of light horſemen more then an ordinary man, and ſo likewiſe the others: which wages may be augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted or doubled in time of warres, if that I ſpeake of be thought to be too little. Touching the eſtate of Chiefes &amp; members, it might continue ſuch as it is at this inſtant, but the Marſhals muſt be raiſed, and the Harbingers ought to haue as much as the light horſemen, and the Trompets as mutch as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hargoletiers: &amp; as for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 2. conductors, they ſhould haue as much as the <hi>Decurions</hi> amongſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of armes, and if ſo be that their wages were paid to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the end of euery 3. moneths, or at the Legion his paſſing muſter, it ſhould not be greatly néedfull to put them into garriſon in time of peace, as we are accuſtomed to do in <hi>Fraunce:</hi> for that I do thinke this wages to be ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to maintaine them at home or elſe-where, without oppreſſing the people through great charge. For what garriſon ſoeuer they haue, or how long ſo euer they do continue in it, you ſée not that they do the King any whit y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> better ſeruice whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the warres come, then if they neuer had bin there. I do not ſay, but if that they did vſe it in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſort that it ought to be vſed, that it were not well done to kéepe the bands in garriſon alwayes, to vſe &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their armes together: but at this day the greateſt part of horſſemen do make their proffites of their garriſons, as the Merchants do of their merchandiſe, and there is almoſt no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, but that the Merchants do ſell their commoditie vnto the firſt that do offer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reaſon for it: &amp; the horſſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do compell the people to buy the victuals which the King doth ordaine for their maintenance, at ſuch prices as they will themſelues, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their dealing is rather a manifeſt raunſome, then a merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.

the muſters they ſhould exerciſe themſelues at home: or if they ſhould be lodged in garriſon, to make them to be longer reſident then they are: and alſo that the Captaines themſelues ſhould kéepe in garriſon, as they did in the time of King <hi>Lewes</hi> the 11. at which time the horſſemen of <hi>Fraunce</hi> caryed the name aboue all other, as well for their readineſſe, as for their furniture: not for their readineſſe in dauncing after diuers faſhions, (and yet a daunce that a man might profit by, were not to be diſliked) nor likewiſe for trimming vp the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues minion-like, nor for ſtuffing themſelues with féeldbeds, or with diuers ſorts of garments, for then there was no accompt made, but of him that handled and rid a horſſe well, &amp; that did run with a launce, fight beſt with the ſword, wraſtled, lept, threw the bar, &amp; vaulted better then other; was moſt eſtéemed, &amp; he alſo had the praiſe aboue his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions that was mounted &amp; armed better then they, ſo that there were few horſſemen but they were mounted with 3. or 4. great horſſe at leaſt, and one of them, or all were barbed. As for their perſons, they were wiſer then to deſtroy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, as Gentlemen do at this day, but they were armed lyke S. <hi>George,</hi> &amp; as full of Crownes, as dogs are of fleas. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, they ſhould be forbidden to ſell their aforeſaid garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or their victuals appointed, and to take vp other prouiſion then that which the King doth ordaine. I vnderſtand that this was forbidden them not long ſince, but whether theſe horſemen be in garriſon or not, they muſt exerciſe themſelus to be nimble, to haue their bodies to be at eaſe in their harneſſe, &amp; accuſtome the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues therevnto, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> neceſſities that may happen: for ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it may ſo fall out, that the horſemen ſhalbe conſtrained to trauaile a long way a foote, wherevnto if they were not accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, they could not indure the waight of their harneſſe, nor do their indeuour at a fight. Moreouer, they ſhould exerciſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to mount a horſeback armed with all their peeces, &amp; the launce in their fiſt, &amp; to light without help, aduantage, or ſtirrup, and therefore it ſhould be neceſſary for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue ſome horſe of wood, to exerciſe themſelues vpon, at the leaſt one houre in a day, that they might be ready to mount &amp; light at the firſt ſigne the Captaine ſhould make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Furthermore, they ſhould exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe to paſſe great riuers a horſeback &amp; armed, &amp; alſo to climb the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:10495:43"/>
hardeſt and raggedſt mountaines that are, and to runne or to go downe them in great haſte, principally the Harquebuſiers, Hargoletiers, and likewiſe the light Horſſemen. As for the men of armes, they muſt continue fyrme, and muſt not ſerue for the purpoſes that they doe at this daye: but ſhould be as a Fort to reſit all aſſaults, and to ouerthrow and breake all thoſe whom they ſhould aſſaile, but becauſe of the runnings and ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes wherein they are ordinarily imployed, which are fyghts wherein oft times of force a man muſt ſlie in ſteed of tarying by it, they haue learned to ſhew their heeles: and therefore it is neceſſary that men of armes ſhould be forbidden fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſkirmiſhes and from all other places where it ſhould be requiſite to flie, and and where they ſhould ſpoile their Horſſes and doe no ſeruice. The Baron of <hi>Gramont,</hi> who died in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> voyage to <hi>Naples,</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that men of armes ſhould neuer be imploied in theſe lyght fights, except it were when as a battell ſhould bee fought throughly: for that they had learned by the cuſtome and order of ſkirmiſhes, to turne their backes vnto their enimies, without feare of reproche, and to ſpeake truth, a Skirmiſh is a ſeruice that appertaineth better vnto light Horſſemen then vnto them: and for the ſame purpoſe onely are the light Horſſemen appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But I would haue them to be exempted from all other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices aſwell as men of armes: and that the Hargoletiers and Harquebuſiers ſhould be ſkoutes, and ſerue for diſcoueries and ſkirmiſhes, and keepe company with the light Horſſemen in all places: and that the light Horſſemen ſhould ſerue to back them, and the men of armes to be the cheefe force. For to ſpeake that I thinke concerning the exerciſes the Horſſemen ought to doo, I ſay fyrſt that the Harquebuſers ſhould exerciſe their Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuſes, and practiſe to ſhoote ſure with both handes, and to diſcharge bothe forward and backward, their horſſes running, and alſo to light to keepe a ſtraight, as Harquebuſiers a foote ſhould do. The Hargoletiers ought to vſe their Iauelings with both hands, ſometime vſing it one way and ſometime another, or as is aboueſaid, but if they doe carrye launces, they muſt vſe them as other men do. The lyght Horſſemen ſhould practiſe to ride well, to manadge a Horſſe, and to run well with a launce,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:10495:44"/>
to vſe their ſwords and maſes when they ſhall bee needfull, the men of armes muſt doo the like, all which Horſſemen ought to haue iudgement in all the deſeaſes that belong vnto a Horſſe for to find remedy therefore: and it would be for their credit if they could bit and ſhooe them, to haue no lacke of any ſmal point belonging vnto their occupation. Theſe Horſſemen armed and practiſed as is aboueſayd, muſt be at the muſter with the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to exerciſe themſelues together, if it were but to knowe and to be acquainted one with another. As for the Horſſemens lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and baggage, muſt be aſwel entrenched as the footmens, but they muſt bring as little with them as they may poſſible, and that they doo bring muſt neither trouble nor lade them in going vnto the muſter. They muſt liue vpon their owne purſes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking any thing from other men, and muſt marche all day armed in good order, kéeping watch at night: and when it is day, before that they doo diſlodge, the Captaine ſhall ſend out Skouts to diſcouer the paſſages vpon the way where the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie ſhall paſſe. And this charge ſhall be giuen vnto certaine <hi>Decurions</hi> of Harquebuſiers, and of Hargoletiers, who ſhall be followed with certaine <hi>Decurions</hi> of light Horſmen to ſuccour them: after whom the baggage may marche, &amp; then the Horſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; &amp; after them the men of armes, &amp; if it were thought to be better to put the baggage behinde then before, it may be done, &amp; behind it ſhall y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt of the Hargoletiers &amp; Harquebuſiers follow. The rankes of euery one of them in marching through the countrie, ſhalbe of whole <hi>Decuries,</hi> except the way be too narrow. In the manner beforeſayde may euery band of Horſſemen marche in their going and comming from the muſter: but before they come thither, the Marſhall and the Harbingers ſhall goe before to prouide their quarter, which ſhalbe ioining vnto the footmens, and they both together ſhall lodge in Campe, in this manner following.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ith the Legion is aſſembled and lodged, we muſt proceed vnto the practiſing of the bands together, aſwell the footmen as the horſemen, to the intent to haue ſeruice of them againſt our enemies: which is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, for which this diſcipline is ordained, &amp; for whoſe well ordering we take all theſe paines. To ſpeake that I thinke, we muſt vnderſtand that the greateſt diſorder that thoſe that frame a Batailon can make, is that they haue no other regard but to make a good head, wherein they place the Captaines, and all the moſt valianteſt men, and the beſt armed of their bands, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no reckoning of the backs, flankes, nor ranks in the midſt, as if the firſt rankes were all the hope of the victorie, and that the other ſerued but to make number. For by this meanes they make all the hazard of the Battaile ſubiect vnto two or three rankes, as if they were immortall, or ſufficient of themſelues to reſiſt an enemie, without the helpe of thoſe that are behinde them: which is directly contrarie vnto the order that the ancient men of war did vſe; for they ordered their men ſo that one ranke might be receaued within another, and one Batailon within an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:10495:46"/>
and ſo to fight reſolutely vntill the verie laſt man. For without this maner it is not poſſible to ſuccour the firſt rankes or to defend them, nor likewiſe to retire them within the other rankes to come to the fight in their places. With which maner of combat, the <hi>Romanes</hi> helped themſelues oftentimes, and for this purpoſe they deuided their Legions into three ſorts of people, which were called <hi>Haſtaries, Princes,</hi> and <hi>Triaries.</hi> The <hi>Haſtaries</hi> made the front or firſt battaile, and their rankes were furniſhed thicke with men. The <hi>Princes</hi> made the ſecond battaile, and their rankes were opener then the firſt. And the <hi>Triaries</hi> who made the third and laſt battaile, had their men ranged ſo wide, that at a neede they could receiue the two firſt battailes. Moreouer their <hi>Velites,</hi> who were light armed, did the ſame ſeruice that our Harquebuſiers do at this preſent, and were placed vpon the wings betwixt the Batailon and the Horſſemen; and they began the battell. And if it were ſo that they ouercame their enemies, they followed the victorie, and if they were driuen backe, they retired vnto the flankes of the Battailon. After whoſe retreat the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> came to fight with their enemies, &amp; if they felt themſelues to weake to reſiſt their enemies, they retired by little and little betwixt the open rankes of the <hi>Princes,</hi> and renued the battaile with them: and if they were then too weake, they both retyred vnto the <hi>Triaries,</hi> with whome they began the combat againe. And if theſe three ſorts were ouerthrowne, there was then no remedye to helpe them. Me thinkes that this manner of releeuing three times is inuincible, becauſe that fortune muſt thriſe abandon you: and moreouer your enemie muſt of neceſſitie fight, and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh you thrice. The <hi>Greeks</hi> vſed not this maner of relieueng with their <hi>Phalanges,</hi> for although they had manye rankes and many Chiefes in their rankes; notwithſtanding there was made but one onely head, and one onely body of them all. And the maner which they vſed to ſuccour one another, was not to retyre one ranke within another as the <hi>Romanes</hi> did: but that one Souldier ſhould enter into anothers place, which they did after this maner. The <hi>Phalange</hi> was ranged by rankes, as our Batailons are, but it was not ſo confuſedly as ours are: for
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:10495:46"/>
euery band did know his place. The <hi>Decuries</hi> (that is the Deceins or Squadrons) were ſo ranged that the Souldiers followed one another in rowes, and not in fronte as we place ours. The firſt man of euery row was called the <hi>Doien</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curion,</hi> (but I will terme him the <hi>Dicenier</hi>) and the laſt man was called the <hi>Guide</hi> behind. The ſecond man of euery rowe was called <hi>Subſtes</hi> &amp; he that followed him was called <hi>Preſtes,</hi> and ſo throughout they were <hi>Subſtes</hi> &amp; <hi>Preſtes,</hi> vntill the ſayde <hi>Guide</hi> which was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Of theſe rowes they had ſo many, that one <hi>Phalange</hi> had 256. men in fronte, or more, and 64. rankes in length. True it is that they were diſtributed vnto foure Colonels, but they marched all in front with a little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance betwixt them. Let vs ſuppoſe that euerye ranke hath 256 men, and let vs ſay that they come to ioyne battaile with their enemies. If it happened that either in going or fighting that anye one of them was ſlaine or ouerthrowne, he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I haue termed <hi>Subſtes,</hi> put himſelfe preſently into the firſt mans place: ſo that by that meanes the Souldiers of the firſt ranke were alwayes their full number. And to fill the ſecond ranke, they of the third ranke which were called <hi>Preſtes,</hi> put forward themſelues into their emptied places; and thoſe of the fourth ranke did furniſh the third, and ſo following: ſo that the laſt rankes did furniſh the firſt, in ſuch ſort that the firſt rankes were alwaies entier. And there was no place left emptie but in the laſt ranke, which waſted becauſe theee was no man to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie it, ſo that the loſſe that the firſt rankes ſuffered, was cauſe of the conſuming of the laſt. By this meanes the <hi>Phalanges</hi> might ſooner be conſumed then diſordred, for to ouerthrowe them was impoſſible, becauſe of their great number. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt vſed <hi>Phalanges,</hi> &amp; inſtructed their people after the <hi>Greekes</hi> manner, but it is long ſithence that they miſliked of their order: and therfore they deuided their people into many bodies: to wit, into <hi>Cohortes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Manipules:</hi> for they thought, as I haue ſaid before, that that bodie which had many ſoules, &amp; was compounded of many partes, ought alſo to haue manie liues. The <hi>Batailons</hi> of the Switzers, Almaignes, ours, and others do ſomewhat imitate the <hi>Phalanges,</hi> aſwell for that wée
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:10495:47"/>
doe range a great number of people together: as alſo that wee doe place them in ſuch ſort that they may enter one into another his place. But why this manner ſhould not be ſo good as the <hi>Romanes,</hi> many examples of the <hi>Romane</hi> Legions do ſhew: for that as often as the <hi>Romanes</hi> fought againſt the <hi>Greekes</hi> their <hi>Phalanges</hi> were ouerthrowne and conſumed by the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for the difference of their armes, and the manner of relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thrée times, had a more force in it then the great number, or the diligence of the <hi>Phalanges.</hi> Being therefore to frame a Batailon after all theſe examples, I haue thought it good to imitate partly the faſhions of the <hi>Greekes Phalanges,</hi> and partly the <hi>Romane</hi> Legions, and partly theſe that we doe vſe at this inſtant: and therefore I would that in euery one of our Legions there ſhould be 3600, ordinarie Pikes for the body of the Batailon, 420. for the flankes, and 170. extraordinarie Pikes for the forlorne hope, which are armes that the <hi>Phalan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> did vſe. Beſides I would haue 600. Halbards, 420. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuſiers for the flankes, and 680. for the forlorne hope, all which are armes inuented in our time.</p>
                     <p>I haue deuided the body of the Batailon into 10. bandes, as the <hi>Romanes</hi> did theirs into 10. <hi>Cohortes,</hi> and haue appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Harquebuſiers, and the forlorne hope to begin the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, and for ſkirmiſhes, as the <hi>Romanes</hi> did their <hi>Velites,</hi> and haue giuen them two Captaines, and two Enſignes, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to haue better ſeruice of them then if they had none: and alſo for to imploye them in the labours of the warres, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bands. And for that the armes are borrowed of diuers nations, the bandes muſt alſo bee perticipants of the orders of diuers nations: and therefore I haue ordained, that euery one of the ten bandes ſhould haue 8 rankes of Pikes before the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, and 8 behinde, and 4 rankes of Halbardes in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt: ſo that by that meanes euery band dooth make 20 rankes, and euery ranke hath 21. men. The Pikes doe ſerue for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt Horſſemen, to breake into the footmen, and to withſtand the firſt aſſaults of their enemies: which Pikes I will vſe onelye to defend my ſelfe, and afterwards vſe the Targets (which the Pikemen doo carry at their backes) and Halbards to vanquiſh
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:10495:47"/>
myne enemies. And who ſo would conſider of the force of this order, ſhall finde that euerye ſort of armes ſhall doo his office thoughlye; for the Pikes are profitable againſt the Horſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: and when the footmen doe meete Batailon againſt Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailon, they ſerue to a good vſe before that the rankes are throng together, but after that they are once at the cloſe, the Pikes can doe no more ſeruice. Wherefore the <hi>Switzers,</hi> to auoide this inconuenience, after euerye three rankes of Pikes do place one ranke of Halbardes, which they doo to the intent to giue their Pikemen ſpace and place to fight in a preaſe; but yet this is not ynough, but as for vs, we will haue our Pikemen both before the Enſigne and behinde to carrye Targets: and there ſhall be Halbardes in the middeſt, by meanes of this order, to reſiſt bothe Horſſemen and footmen, and to breake into an eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: for you know that Pikes may ſerue no turne after that the rankes are preaſſed together, becauſe that the Souldiers are then as it were one in anothers necke: and therefore if the Pikemen had nothing but their Pikes and Swordes the Pike being abandoned they ſhould be naked: for which cauſe I haue giuen them Targets to couer themſelues from blowes, and to fight in all places, what preaſe ſoeuer there were. Moreouer the Halbardiers maye alſo fight better in a preaſe then the Pikemen, which Halbardiers are expreſſely appointted for this purpoſe, and likewiſe they may followe the ſayde Targets at the heeles, who are heauily laden, to reſkue them with their Halbards. And as for the Target men, I would haue them but onely to thruſt at the face and legges, or at any other parte that were vnarmed. But leauing theſe ſmall things. I will goe range the ten bands in one whole Batailon.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ho ſo would range ten bands in a Batai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, muſt firſt put a ſide by themſelues the Pikemen, and Harquebuſiers that are appoynted for the flanks: thoſe of the one 5 ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds on the one ſide, &amp; thoſe of the other on the other. And likewiſe one ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the forlorne hope on the one ſide, &amp; the other on the other ſide, in ſuch ſorte that the ſaid bandes of theſe two flankes ſhall leaue a great voide ſpace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, for to range the batailon in, which ſhalbe done after this manner. The firſt band ſhall goe before the ſecond, and the ſecond before the third, and the third before the fourth, and ſo likewiſe the others. They ſhal marche in their ſingle order that is fiue and fiue in a ranke as I haue ſaid before. Afterwards the Colonell ſhall commaund his trumpet to ſound, that the King commaundeth them to double their rankes. And then the ranks of fiue ſhall be doubled and made 10. This done the Colonell, or Sergeant Maior ſhall commaunde the trumpet to ſounde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that the King commaundeth them expreſly to redouble their rankes, which at this ſecond cry ſhalbe 20. in the middeſt of euerie ranke ſhall the Chiefe of Squadron place him-ſelfe to make it to be 21. The Trumpet ſhall ſounde the third time by commaundement as before, and at this ſound the firſt bande ſhal goe forward vnto the place where the front of the Batailon ſhall be placed, and ſhal ſtay there in that order that I haue ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the perticular bands. The ſpace which euerie Souldier muſt occupie marching in ſingle order muſt bee three paces, in bataile 2, and when he fighteth 1. The diſtance from one ranke vnto another being in ſingle order muſt be 4. paces, and being placed in battaile 2. and in fight one. So that the ſaid 21. men being in battaile will occupie 42. paces in fronte, and the 20. rankes will occupie 60. in length, heere in compryſed the ſpace
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:10495:48"/>
that euery Souldier dooth occupie which is one pace. The firſt band being ſo ranged, the ſecond ſhall march as far forwarde as the firſt, and place it ſelfe vpon the right hand of it, and ſhall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie as great a ſpace in breadth and length as it doeth. Their rankes ſhall bee ſtraight in the flankes one by another, and the two bands thus ranged together, ſhall make 42. in fronte, and their order ſhall bee all one, they muſt haue a ſpace left betwixt them of 5. paces broade. The thirde band ſhall bee brought for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vpon the left ſide of the firſt bande, and ſhall bee ranged like vnto the other two, and not otherwiſe, and betwixt it and the firſt ſhall alſo a ſpace be left of 5. paces broade. The fourth band ſhall bee brought forward vppon the right ſide of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and ſhall bee ranged in rankes and ſpaces like vnto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and ſhall alwaies make the right corner. The fyft ſhall bee brought forwarde vppon the left ſide of the third bande, and ſhall bee ranged as the others, and ſhall alwaies make the left corner. Theſe fiue bands thus ordered doe make 105. men in front, and doe occupie in breadth 230 paces, and 60. in length. at the taile of theſe bands, we muſt range the ſixt, ſeauenth, and eight band, right behinde the other fiue, and diſtant from them 25. paſes, and in ſuch ſorte that theſe three bands muſt occupie as greate a breadth in front as the other fiue: and therefore the men muſt be ranged much opener the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe in the firſt fiue. The ſixt band ſhall bee in the midſt, the ſeauenth vppon the right ſide of it, and the eyght vppon the left: which three bands doe make 63. in fronte, and the ſpace which they occupie in length is 90. paces. At the backs of theſe three bands ſhall the ninth and tenth band be placed right behinde them, and diſtant from them 25. paces. The ninth ſhalbe on the right ſide, and the tenth on the left, and they ſhall occupie as much breadth as the firſt fiue. True it is that the rankes of theſe two bands ſhall bee opener then thoſe of the ſecond battaile are: but it is neceſſarie that they ſhoulde bee ſo, for the reaſon that I will ſhewe you by and by.</p>
                     <p>Their order ſhal be like vnto the other bands, but that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce of the rankes of theſe two bands, ſhall be more then the diſtance of the rankes of the others: for whereas the rankes of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:10495:49"/>
the ſecond battaile doth occupie but 90. paces fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the firſt ranke vnto the laſt, theſe ſhall occupie 120. paces: wherefore al the 10. bands together will occupie 230. paces in breadth, and 320. from the fyrſt ranke of the Batailon vntill the laſt. Moreouer I would that theſe three battailes ſhould haue certaine expreſſe names: for the <hi>Romanes</hi> did ſo diſtinguiſh theirs, naming (as I haue ſaid before) the Souldiers of the fyrſt battaile <hi>Haſtari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> thoſe of the ſecond <hi>Princes,</hi> and thoſe of the thirde <hi>Triaries.</hi> For to arme the flankes, fyrſt for the right flanke I would take the Pikemen of the fyrſt, ſecond, fourth, ſeuenth, and ninth band, and would range them alongſt the Batailon two and two, ſo that the flanke ſhould repreſent as great a number of men as the front doeth. The Harquebuſiers of the fiue bands aforeſaide, ſhall alſo bee ranged two and two together alongſt the flanke of theſe pikes, fyue or ſix paces diſtant from them. The Pike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the third, fyft, ſixt, eyght, and tenth bande ſhall be on the left ſide and ſhalbe ranged like vnto thoſe vpon the right ſide, and the Harquebuſiers like vnto the other. The Corporals of both flankes ſhal be by themſelues before their men. The two bands of the forelorne hope, ſhal be the one vpon the one flanke, and the other vpon the other. The Harquebuſiers ſhalbe ranged in 16 rankes, and their Pikes in 4, euerie one of which ranke ſhall haue 21 men, their Enſigne ſhalbe in the midſt of their Pikes. The one companie of 100. men of armes ſhall bee vppon the one flanke, and the other vppon the other flanke, and ſhall bee like vnto two wings. As for the light Horſemen they ſhall be ranged before the men of armes, or at their ſides, who ſo would, in ſuch ſorte that they both to gether might make one fronte: or if you would range them both by two <hi>Decuries,</hi> and two <hi>Decu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> you may doe it. The Hargoletiers ſhall be before them and the Harquebuſiers a horſebacke formoſt, the Captaines ſhall bee before the men of armes, the Lieutenants before the light horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, &amp; the Conductors before the Hargoleteires, and the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuſiers; either of them before his charge. The Colonel ſhall place himſelfe in the voide place betwixt the <hi>Haſtaries,</hi> and the <hi>Princes,</hi> or at the head of the Batailon, at one of the corners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the fourth bande and the Pikes vpon the right flanke, or
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:10495:49"/>
betwixt the fyft bande and the Pikes, vpon the left flanke, as it ſhall ſeeme beſt. I would that he ſhould haue with him in his Squadron, the Sergant Maior, and ſome choſen men, that knewe wiſelye to execute a commiſſion of importance. His Trumpet and Drum Maior, ſhall be alwayes by him to ſound and to ſignifie his commaundement ſpeedilye. When the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailon ſhall be thus ordered, the Colonell ſhall commaund his Trumpet to ſound, that his men ſhould marche eaſilye, and in a while after ſhall ſounde to make them to goe faſter, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhall ſound the combate. The <hi>Haſtaries</hi> muſt not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten to be taught how they ſhould retire themſelues within the <hi>Princes:</hi> nor how both theſe Battailes of <hi>Haſtaries</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> ſhould retyre vnto the <hi>Triaries,</hi> which muſt be doone without diſordering or breaking themſelues. The Pikes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the flankes ought to retire, as the Battailes doe retire: to wit, the firſte ranke into the ſeconde, the thirde ranke into the fourth, and the fift into the ſixt, and the others conſequentlye. The forlorne hope, and the Horſſemen ſhall doe ſo likewiſe. This doone a retreat ſhall be ſounded, and euerye bande ſhall fall of a part, and put their men into ſingle order, to reenter the Campe as they came out. And if it ſhould ſéeme better to range the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Triaries</hi> in one front, they might be ſo aſwell as the <hi>Haſtaries:</hi> for then there néede no more to be doone, but to make the ninth and the tenth bande, to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues betwixt the ſecond and third band, in whole bands: and that the ſayd <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Triaries</hi> ſhould keepe the ſame order that the fiue bands of <hi>Haſtaries</hi> doe keepe, and occupie as much ground in breadth and length as the ſayd <hi>Haſtaries</hi> doe occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie: or otherwiſe foure bands of the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> might make the front, and the fyft might be placed in the middle Battailon, with one bande of <hi>Princes,</hi> and both theſe bandes might range themſelues in ten rankes, 42. men in euery ranke: and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth and eyght band of the ſayde <hi>Princes</hi> might bee ranged with the <hi>Triaries:</hi> and ſo there ſhould be aſwell foure bandes behinde, as foure before, and two in the middeſt all ranged lyke vnto the <hi>Haſtaries:</hi> or theſe two bandes may bee behinde occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyeng
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:10495:50"/>
the place of the <hi>Triaries</hi> according vnto <hi>Polibius</hi> his order, who would that the <hi>Triaries</hi> ſhould bee alwayes the one halfe leſſer then the <hi>Princes</hi> or <hi>Haſtaries:</hi> ſo that in eache of the other Battailes there ſhould bee foure bandes, and in this but two, prouided that whereas theſe two bands before made 20. rankes, they ſhould then make but 10: to the intent that their frontes ſhould ſtretch as wide as the frontes of the other Battailes.</p>
                     <p>Wee might alſo range one of theſe Legions in forme of a <hi>Phalange,</hi> but to make it iuſt ſquare as the order of the ſayde <hi>Phalange</hi> requireth, wee muſt alter a great part of the order of theſe Legions, for to doe it ſo that there ſhould be no difference. But as concerning one of thoſe Legions that I haue framed heere before, I haue ſhewed the order that I would obſerue in ranging one of them in Battaile or manie: notwithſtanding if I ſhould range one of thoſe Legions which the King hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> I would proceed after another maner, if ſo bee that the manner of <hi>Haſtaries, Princes,</hi> and <hi>Triaries</hi> before ſpoken of, were diſliked: for in this caſe I would make but two Battailes, in the firſt I would place three bands and their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes; and in the laſt three bandes and their Enſignes: and this I would doe according vnto the manner that I haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the ſeauenth Chapter, where I haue ſhewed howe to range one of theſe bandes alone: ſo that the three bandes ſhould make 75. men in front, which bandes with the two ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of 5 paces broade left betwixt euery one of them, will occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie 160. paces in breadth: and the 24. rankes will occupie 70. paces in length. I would place the other three bandes behinde them in the ſelfe-ſame order, that they are in, but as they ſhould make the force behinde, and ſtand euen in ranke with the firſt: ſo I would haue a diſtance of 20. paces broad betwixt them and the firſt: by this meanes the length of the Battailon might be 160. paces. The extraordinarie Pikes of three bands, ſhould ſerue for the one flanke, and theſe of the other three for the other, ranged two and two together: and the Harquebuſiers for the flankes a little diſtant from them. The
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:10495:50"/>
forelorne hope ſhall march before vppon the winges, and the horſemen ſhall keepe the ſame place that they kepe in the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons aboue ſaide; and the Colonell ſhall be at one of the corners, betwixt the bands and the Pikemen in the flanke, or elſe where it might bee thought moſt expedent. And although that this forme might ſeeme to be very good, yet is it ſo that the manner before ſpoken of is much more ſure: becauſe of the meanes that it hath to relieue it ſelfe three times, and to fight thrice; which this Legion here laſt ranged cannot doe: for if it fought well once, it woulde bee all; notwithſtanding it might bee taught through long exerciſe, how the one ranke might fight after the other, which to do it ſhould be neceſſarie to teache the firſt ranke to retire within the ſecond, and ſo the others vnto the verie laſt man, not putting any men out of his place, which may be eaſilie done; ſo that thoſe which ſhould make place for them to paſſe do put themſelues a little aſide, &amp; immediatly come into their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againe. The like muſt bee done when the ſecond ſhoulde retire, and the other alſo: ſo that this manner might bee obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued I woulde much eſteeme of this laſt manner. And at the vttermoſt which ſoeuer of theſe manners you range them in, it may ſerue: ſo that the Souldiers be often practiſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
                     <p>But to repeat my ſayings from the fyrſt vnto the laſt, the Legion which I haue framed after the auncient manner ſhould be exerciſed in diuerſe exerciſes euerie day, as long as it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neweth together, and by this meanes the Colonell ſhould finde the diligence, and negligence of the Captaines, in the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of their Souldiers: to the intent to praiſe or blame them in the preſence of al men according vnto their deſarts: &amp; the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhall learne alſo to range themſelues together, vnto whome ſhall be ſhewed all the exerciſes that they ought to do in general being before accuſtomed, vnto their perticular exerciſes. And for their better inſtruction it ſhould be neceſſarie that the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould aſſemble twice a yeare at the leaſt, and that the bands ſhould excerciſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues perticularly euerie moneth or oftener if it were poſſible: and the Souldiers by themſelues euerie
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:10495:51"/>
holie day with their Deceniers, Chiefes of ſquadrons, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals. The Colonell ought to exhort them vnto this, and vnto all other vertuous exerciſes both publikly and priuately: and afterward to giue them leaue to tourne vnto their owne houſes: which retourning ſhall bee in euerie poynte like vnto their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the muſter, keeping the ſame manner of matching, lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and well lyieng that is ſpoken of. Which ought to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued as often as the Kings doeth leuie a Legion for his warres. I haue cauſed in this place the forme to bee ſhewed that one of theſe Legions aboueſaide ſhall haue being ranged in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ith we haue inſtructed the Legions ſeuerally, it followeth that we ſhould now ſpeake of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of raunging of one whole Battaile together. And for to do this, it were neceſſary in this paſſage to declare amply after what manner the <hi>Greekes</hi> and the <hi>Romanes</hi> ordered their Battailes, but ſith that their manner may be found and conſidered of by euery man in the auncient Authors that do write thereof: I will leaue many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of their faſhions, and will ſpeake only of the moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaryeſt, and of that which we ought to borrow of them, to giue ſome little perfection vnto the Militarie Diſcipline of our time. This doing, I will ſhew all vnder one, how an Army muſt be ordered vpon a day of Battaile, and in what order one Hoaſt doth approach and aſſayle another, being their enemyes, and the manner how to exerciſe them in fayned Battailes. We muſt vnderſtand, that in an ordinary Hoaſt of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> which they called <hi>Conſularis,</hi> there were but two Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of the Citizens of <hi>Rome,</hi> which were in number <hi>600.</hi> horſſemen, and <hi>10000.</hi> footemen: beſides, they had as many of their aſſiſtants, as of their owne, who were deuided into two parts, the one was called the right corner, the other the left. They would neuer ſuffer that theyr aſſiſtants ſhould be more in number then theyr Legionaries, but as for the horſſemen, they made no great accompt, although they were more in number then theirs. With ſuch an army of <hi>20000</hi> footemen, and about <hi>1500.</hi> horſſe of ſeruice at the vttermoſt, a <hi>Conſull</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> did enterpriſe all factions, and did execute them. True it is, that when as they were to deale with a verye great force of theyr enemyes, they aſſembled two <hi>Conſuls,</hi> and cauſed the two Hoaſtes <hi>Conſulares,</hi> to ioyne together.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:10495:54"/>
We muſt note moreouer that in all the thrée principall actions that an army doth, as in marching, lodging, and fighting, the aforeſaid <hi>Romanes</hi> did put theyr Legions in the middeſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would that the force which they truſted moſt, ſhould be moſt vnited: yet their confederates were not inferiours vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, becauſe of the great practiſe that they had together: for in truth they were practiſed and raunged after one manner. As they had two Legions of their owne Citizens, and two of their aſſiſtants in euery one of their hoaſts, ſo likewiſe I will take foure Legions of <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> or two at the leaſt, and they ſhall be of <hi>6100.</hi> footemen, for this number liketh me beſt, for that <hi>Vegetius</hi> hath vſed it in the framing of his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, and of the two aboueſaid Legions I will make my principall force. If ſo be that we would haue ſtrange ſouldyers amongſt them, I would place the ſayd ſtrangers at the two corners of the army as the <hi>Romanes</hi> did their aſſiſtants. But I ſuppoſe that there ſhall be no ſtrangers in the hoaſt that I will make at this preſent, or if there ſhould be, I would not haue the number of the Legions which I require to be dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: but that there ſhould alwayes be foure: by the ordering of which foure, may eaſily be vnderſtoode how a greater ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye ſhould be raunged: for if there ſhould be a greater number of people then the ſayd foure Legions, there were no more to do but to make many ſmall Batailons, and to place them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde and at the ſides of the Bataile, in forme of Subſides, to ſuccour any part of the Batailon that might be oppreſſed: of which Subſides it ſhall be neceſſary to vſe for the diuers formes of Batailons that enemyes oftentimes do make, to the intent that without changing or taking any thing out of place, we might at all times haue wherewithall to reſiſt them: as if any of the enemyes Batailons ſhould be raunged in Point, that is, with a narrow ſtrong battaile, we might immediatly bring forward thoſe that are behinde, and thoſe vpon the flanks, and range them in the forme of two vnited forces, to receiue and incloſe betwixt them the enemyes Point when it ſhall approch: or if the ſaid enemyes ſhould march with their front of great breadth, they then might march in Point, and force to breake
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:10495:54"/>
into them. Theſe people would be alſo good to repulſe thoſe that ſhould ſodainely charge vpon the flanks of the Batailon or behind, they may alſo ſerue to relieue thoſe that are in danger, or to ſtrike downe thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> runne away: and for many other good actions (which I leaue to ſpeake of) wherein we might employ thoſe that might be in our Camps ouer and aboue the ſaid four Legions: notwithſtanding for theſe purpoſes there néede none to be leuied, ſith the Forlorne hope, &amp; thoſe of the flanks might ſerue the turne. Furthermore, I thinke that it ſhall not be néed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to recite againe the number of people that I haue appointed for euery Legion, nor that there are tenne ordenary bands, and two extraordinary: nor what armes and weapons they ſhould carry, nor the diuerſitie of Pikemen, nor what officers &amp; Chiefs there ſhould be in euery Legion: becauſe that I haue before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited them perticularly, wherefore without any more repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſay that the firſt Legion (for they muſt all be diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by degrées) ought at all times to be raunged in the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailon in one place, and the others likewiſe. Therefore I would that the firſt Legion ſhould keepe the right ſide, and the ſecond the left, and that the firſt rankes of the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> of theſe two Legions ſhould be raunged as farre forward the one as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and all the other rankes following. And for a more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt demonſtration, ſuppoſe that the enemyes be towards the Eaſt, and that we do raunge the fronts of our battailes towards them, the firſt Legion being vpon the right hand on the South ſide, the ſecond Legion vpon the left hand on the North ſide, and their backs towards the Weſt: and the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> one right againſt another, &amp; one as far forward as an other, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>Princes</hi> &amp; <hi>Triaries</hi> of both theſe two Legions, muſt likewiſe kéepe one and the ſelfe-ſame order, ranks, ſpaces, &amp; diſtances: there muſt a ſpace be left betwixt the two Legions from the front vnto the tayle, which muſt be thirty paces broade: theſe two Legions ſhall occupy the place that the two Legions of the Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> did occupy. I would haue the third Legion to be placed on the right corner, &amp; the fourth on the left, and raunged in the ſelfe-ſame order that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two Legions betwixt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are, with ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces betwixt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>30.</hi> paces broade: ſo that the foure Legions
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:10495:55"/>
ſhould occupy in breadth a thouſand paſes or more. The <hi>Forlorne hope</hi> ſhall be at the head, and the horſſemen of the firſt and third Legion ſhall be on the right wing: and the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the ſecond and fourth Legion vppon the left wing. And for to gouerne this army well, it would be neceſſary to haue certayne principall Chiefes; and Officers, who ſhould be ſubiect and obedient vnto one Lieutenant Generall. There ſhall be therefore two Chiefes, to wéet, one Captaine generall of the horſſemen, vnto whome, all the Captaynes that haue charge of horſſemen, muſt be obedient. The other ſhall be Captayne generall ouer the footemen, vnto whome, all the Colonels and Captaines that haue charge of footemen ſhall be obedient. The dignitie of theſe two Chiefes is equall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the one commaundeth ouer the one kinde of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyers, and the other ouer the other: and they are the higheſt degrées that are in an army (excepting the Generall chiefe) and vnto which eſtates all other degrées may aſpire, each one in his facultie, as he that is a horſſeman, may attaine to be Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne generall ouer horſſemen: and he that is a footeman, may attayne to be Captayne generall ouer the footemen: to ariſe vnto which dignities, there muſt be as many degrées paſſed in the one facultie, as in the other: for I make twelue degrées in either of them. Firſt amongſt the footemen there is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>Forlorne hope,</hi> amongſt whom, I would place all thoſe which I would inrowle to fill a Legion. The ſecond place is to be of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flanks, &amp; in theſe two places they ſhould paſſe through all offices ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Corporals, before that they ſhould be of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailon, &amp; being of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Battailon, they ſhould firſt be Pikemen or Halbardiers amongſt the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> which is the third place, the fourth, are the <hi>Princes,</hi> the fift, <hi>Triaries,</hi> the ſixt to be <hi>Dece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier,</hi> the ſeauenth to be chiefe of Squadron, the eight to be Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, the ninth to be Enſigne-bearer, whether it were of the Batailon, or of the <hi>Forlorne hope,</hi> the tenth Lieutenant, the eleuenth Captaine, the twelfth Colonell. And for the Horſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the firſt point is to be Harquebuſiers, the ſecond Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goletiers, the third light horſſemen, the fourth a man of Armes, the fift a <hi>Decurion</hi> of Harquebuſiers, the ſixt
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:10495:55"/>
a <hi>Decurion</hi> of Hargoletiers: the <hi>7.</hi> a <hi>Decurion</hi> of light horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the eight, a <hi>Decurion</hi> of men of armes, or conductors of hargoletiers or Harquebuſiers, the ninth <hi>Guydon,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tenth En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, the eleuenth Lieutenant, and the twelfth Captaine. Concerning the other places as Harbingers, Sergeants of Bands, Sergeants, Maiors, Marſhals of Legions, Maiſters of Campe, or Prouoſt (for it is all one) and others, theirs are offices, but not degrées, whereby a man ought to attaine vnto the eſtates of the two Soueraignes, except the King did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point it to be ſo, who may alter and change all orders. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the officers that ought to be in an Hoaſt, beſides theſe that I haue héere ſpoken of, there muſt be firſt of all ſome wiſe man who ſhould execute the office of Chauncellor or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, as you will tearme him: and a maiſter of the Ordinance, a Threaſorer, and a Marſhall of the Campe, we might appoint alſo a Prouoſt generall. Now to appoint vnto euery one of theſe principall Chiefe their places, the army being ready for the Combate, and likewiſe vnto the other officers heere aboue named, we muſt ſay that the Lieutenant Generall ought to be vpon the right ſide, betwixt the footemen and the horſſemen, for that is the fitteſt place to gouerne an army. The Kings Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Generall may haue in his company a <hi>100.</hi> or <hi>200.</hi> cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen men, ſome a horſſebacke, and ſome a foote, of which number there ſhall be ſome ſufficient to execute a charge of importance, he himſelfe muſt be a horſſebacke, and ſo armed, that he might helpe himſelfe both a horſſebacke and a foote, according vnto the occaſion that might be giuen. His Cornet muſt be by him, which is the Enſigne of thoſe that are Chiefes of Armyes, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Kings Trompet, generally after whoſe ſound, all the Trom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets of the army muſt gouerne themſelues, and the ſouldyers likewiſe. The Lieutenant generall of the army ought then to be vpon the right ſide, for it is the fitteſt place to giue order vnto all parts of the battaile, and to ouer-looke them with leaſt trouble, except the ſcituation of the place were fitter vpon the other ſide: but I ſuppoſe that this Hoaſt is raunged in ſome faire plaine. The Captaine generall of the footemen ſhall be at the head of that ſpace, that is left betwixt the two middle Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:10495:56"/>
to gouerne all the foure Legions, and to remedy the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents that may happen: and therefore he ſhall haue about him certaine extraordinary footemen, or may vſe certaine Pike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and harquebuſiers of the flanks if he will: ſpecially thoſe of the flanks betwixt the two middle Legions, for it will be long before that they ſhould be aſſayled there. The Captaine Generall of the horſſemen ſhall be vpon the left ſide to gouerne there as the Lieutenant Generall doth gouerne the right ſide: and may haue about him certaine footemen, Pikes, and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuſiers, which he ſhall take from the <hi>Forlorne hope,</hi> and ſhall cauſe them to fight amongſt the horſſemen without kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping order. The Ordnance ought to be placed at the front of the Army, except the ground were ſuch that it might be placed vpon the flanks, or elſe-where in ſome ſure place where the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes might not eaſily come to it. The maiſter of the Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ought to be with his charge, and his Officers and Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners with him: a good number of the chiefe Officers ought to be about the King his Lieutenant Generall, and the reſt behinde the Battailes, to haue a regard vnto that might happen there. As for the Baggage, it ſhould be placed in ſome place either ſtrong by nature or by arte, and the ſeruaunts of the Hoaſt may kéepe it, and for this purpoſe I required that they ſhould be choſen to be ſuch as might ſerue for ſouldyers at a néede. And an Hoaſt ranged after this manner héere ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, might in fight do aſmutch as the <hi>Greekes Phalanges,</hi> or as the <hi>Romane</hi> Legions might do, becauſe that there are Pikemen in the front, and vpon the ſides: and moreouer, the Souldyers are ranged in ſutch ſort, that if the firſt ranke ſhould be ſlaine or beaten downe in fight, then thoſe that are in the ſecond, might preſently ſupply theyr places, and fill theyr ranks, according vnto the vſe of the <hi>Phalanges.</hi> On the other part, if the firſt ranks of <hi>Haſtaries</hi> were ſo violently charged, that they ſhould be enforced to breake, they might then retire vnto the <hi>Princes</hi> which are at their backs, and range them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues anew betwixt their ranks, who are not ſo thicke placed as the <hi>Haſtaries,</hi> for they are two bands leſſe then they. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, there is a greater diſtance from the firſt ranke of the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:10495:56"/>
Princes vnto the laſt, then the ſaid <hi>Haſtaries</hi> do occupie in their order, and therefore they may fight anew, and ſhew their faces being ranged with the <hi>Princes.</hi> And when as this would not ſerue the turne, they might retyre the ſecond time, as they did the firſt, and enter betwixt the <hi>Triaries,</hi> and fight the third time, ſo that this manner of relieuing, &amp; furniſhing of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of thoſe that are ſtriken downe, is both according vnto the <hi>Greekes</hi> and <hi>Romanes</hi> manner. Furthermore, it were not poſſible to frame a more ſtronger forme of Battaile then this, becauſe that all the ſides of the Battailes are moſt excelently well furniſhed with Chiefes and good armes, ſo that they can not be aſſayled at any part that is not ſtrong and well gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, héerewith conſidered that the enemyes are verie ſeldome ſo great a number as they might aſſayle thoſe with whome they ſhould haue to do alike vpon all partes. And if it were ſo that they were ſtrong ynough to do it, I would neuer coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile the weaker to offer the Battaile, nor to accept it, nor to goe out of his Fort into an open Countrey. But if the enemy were ſo ſtrong, that he had three times as mutch people as you, and as good Souldyers as yours, and ſhould aſſayle you in diuers places, if you could repulſe but the one part, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers would do no great deede: for who ſo ſhould aſſayle hys enemyes vpon diuers ſides, muſt of neceſſitie weaken and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh his Battayles, and be conſtrained to range them ſo farre aſunder, that if one part ſhould be repulſed, hauing no body to ſuccour it, the other parts would be diſmayed, or at leaſt would but weakely reſiſt. And as for the enemy his horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, if they were ſtronger then you, yet are you aſſured from them, by meanes of the Pikes which enuiron your Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayles vppon euery ſide: for what ſide ſo euer ſhould be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayled, you haue Pikemen to defend the ſame: moreouer, the officers, numbers, &amp; Chiefes, are diſtributed into ſutch places, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they may eaſily commaund their people, &amp; obey their Captain generall. The diſtances betwixt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ranks, bands, &amp; battailes, do not only ſerue for to receiue one another, but alſo to make place for thoſe that come and goe, to carry &amp; re-carry the commaunds
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:10495:57"/>
of the Chiefes. Furthermore I haue ſaid that the <hi>Romanes</hi> had in foure of their Legions the number of <hi>21000.</hi> footemen, which were all the people that they commonly had in one of their armyes. This Hoaſt which I frame heere, hath <hi>25000.</hi> not accompting the principall Chiefes, and Officers, who alſo haue ſome followers. Finally, they had horſſemen, ſo likewiſe mine haue a good number, who are better armed and furniſhed then theirs were: wherefore ſith the battailes are raunged in all points readie to fight, there reſteth nothing but to ſet theſe people aworke. I do require therefore that I may be héere permitted to giue battaile with theſe foure Legions, againſt another great Hoaſt of Enemyes, to the intent to ſhewe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what manner I would haue them to fight: afterward, I will giue a reaſon for that I cauſe them to do during the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, which battaile I do fayne by imagination.</p>

Or elſe let vs put caſe that our enemyes are come out of their Fort, and our men alſo, and that both the one and the other meane nothing elſe but to méere, and are approched within Cannon ſhot. Let vs alſo ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that the ſaid enemyes are raunged in very good forme of battaile, and that they haue a great force of all ſorts of people, aſwell footeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as horſemen, &amp; beſides, good ſtore of Ordnance.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:10495:57"/>
to enter into battaile is large and plaine: ſo that the ſcituation cannot helpe the one to annoy the other. The matter being in theſe termes, and the two armies in ſight, there reſteth no more but to giue fire vnto the péeces, and to diſcharge them. You may now ſee that the gunners do not ſleepe on neither ſide, and alſo heare how the cannon doth rore. Let vs marke what mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it doth. Haue you ſeene how little hurt our Ordnance hath done vnto the enemies at the firſt vollie? Herevpon the King his Lieutenant Generall, doth cauſe his Trumpet to ſound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the battaile. This done, you ſee our Forlorne hope, and our Harquebuziers of the flanckes do go forwards out of their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and our Harquebuziers on horſebacke, and Hargoletiers likewiſe: and they altogether aſſault their enemies without kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping any ranke, approaching them moſt furiouſly, and with the greateſt crye that they can make. The enemies Ordnance hath paſſed ouer our footmens heads, not hurting them, and to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it for ſhooting the ſecond time, our Forlorne hope, Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buziers on horſebacke, and Hargoletiers do runne vpon it, and do all their endeuour to winne it, and the enemies to defend it: ſo that neither their Ordnance, nor ours may do any more ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. You ſee how our horſemen and footmen mingled one with another, do fight valiantly and to good purpoſe, ſuccouring one another (the practiſe which they haue had, and the truſt that they repoſe in the Battailons that are at their backes, are cauſes of it:) which Battailons haue alreadie kiſt the ground, and march orderly as you ſee, a good pace, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> horſemen at their wings, euery ranke of men of armes being one hundred horſe. And the light horſemen, who do make as many rankes as they, are vpon the out-ſide of the men of armes, and are one ranke after an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and do march all very cloſe: marke how our Ordnance is retired into the ſpaces that are left betwixt the Legions, for to make place for our Battailes, and to leaue them the way free. Do you ſee how the King his Lieutenant Generall, and the Captaine Generalls of the horſemen and footmen, do go before the Battailons, encouraging the Souldiers to do well, and the Captaines alſo calling euery man by his name, or by his office, declaring vnto them the victorie to be in their hands, ſo that they
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:10495:58"/>
abide and reſiſt the enemies charge without feare? Do you marke how our Harquebuziers on horſebacke, and our Hargo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letiers do open themſelues to make place for our battailes, and how the Harquebuziers of the flanckes do returne into their places? The Forlorne hope of the right ſide do returne vnto the right ſide, and thoſe of the left vnto the left, and do retire with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare or flight, although they haue the enimie at their héeles, and a farre greater number then they are, and how they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne all at once: to weet, the Forlorne hope of two Legions together toward the one ſide, and the Forlorne hope of the other two Legions together toward the other ſide, to put themſelues into a newe order, the Pikemen by themſelues, and Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buziers by themſelues: which Pikemen of each two Legions do ranke themſelues in eight rankes, and euery ranke is a Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of 21. men: for they are all of this number, which is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient number to repreſent a ſmall Battailon. But theſe two ſmall Battailons are raunged as you may ſee behind the <hi>Tria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> each of them right behind the ſpace that is betwixt the two Legions, &amp; the Harquebuziers do raunge themſelues in troopes by them to defend them behind, while the fronts do fight.</p>
                     <p>They do alſo remaine there for to bée imployed when as the Lieutenant Generall ſhould haue occaſion to vſe them. But whileſt I appoynt our Forlorne hope their place at the tayle of our Legions, I do ſee that the two armies are come together vnto the puſh of the Pike. Marke how reſolutely our Battai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons do withſtand the violence of the enemie, and with what vertue and ſilence they do it. The King his Lieutenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall commaundeth the men of armes ſtoutly to reſiſt, but not to aſſaile, and that they ſhould not ſeperate themſelues from the footmen: and therevpon commaundeth the light horſemen to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile, and after they haue executed their charge, they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe into their places. On the other part, I ſee that our Harquebuziers on horſebacke, and the Hargoletiers and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuziers of the right flancke, are gone to charge certaine troopes of the enemies Harquebuziers, who would charge our men vpon the flanck: and I ſee that the enemies light horſemen haue ſuccoured their men immediatly, and that at this inſtant
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:10495:58"/>
the horſemen on both ſides are ſo intermingled, that the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuziers can do no ſeruice with their Harquebuzzes, but are conſtrained to retire vnto their people. Whileſt this is in hand, two of our Guydons go to ſuccour our horſemen, and charge the enemie ſo couragiouſly that they force them to retire: and hauing repulſed them, our light horſemen do afterward returne to their places. Marke how our Harquebuziers on horſebacke and Hargoletiers do trouble the enemies without ceaſe? Do you not ſee that our Pikemen do fight brauely? Our men and the enemies are ſo néere togither that they can no more vſe their Pikes: ſo that our firſt rankes of the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> (according vnto our Militarie diſcipline) do leaue their Pikes and take their Swords and Targets, which they do vſe only in thruſting. Herewithall you may ſee how a great troope of the enemies horſemen haue repulſed our Hargoletiers vpon the left ſide, who do retire towards the Pikes of the ſame flancke, with whom and the Harquebuziers they turne their faces and do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt their enemies. Do you ſee how our light horſemen do go to ſuccour them? See how they charge the ſayd enemies one band after another. Harke how they breake their Launces: ſee how they are mingled: behold the murther which the Pikes of the ſayd flancke do make of the enemies horſes, running be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt our horſemen, who do backe them againſt the enemies aſſaults: and our ſayd Pikes do alſo helpe to defend the light horſemen. He hath good lucke that is ouerthrowne, if he eſcape the footmens hands without death. Do you not ſee how the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies men of armes come to aſſaile our men of armes of the ſayd flancke, whileſt the light horſemen and others are buſied o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther where? Do you ſee how the Forlorne hope of the two Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of the ſame left ſide of the battaile, do go in great haſt to ſuccour our men of armes? But they are ſomewhat too farre of to come time enough, notwithſtanding they make as much haſt as poſſibly they may do, in the ſame order that they are raunged in. In the meane while the enemie his men of armes do charge ours as much as the horſes can runne, but marke well the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of our men who ſtand ſtill to receiue them. But aſſoone as the Captaine generall his Trompet doth ſound, they do runne
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:10495:59"/>
all at once: although the raſe be not aboue twentie or thirtie pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And this they haue done (as I think) to reſiſt their enemies the more forciblie. Haue you ſeene how our men of armes haue with their Launces galled the enemies horſes in their breaſtes and ſides? being ſure that the enemies could neither hurt their perſons nor their horſes, becauſe that they are very well armed themſelues, and their horſes are barbed and garniſhed with Chamfrings and Criniers, which the enemies do want: which is the cauſe that you do ſee ſo many of the enemies ſlaine, and ſo fewe of ours. Marke how our men with the force of their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and with the thruſtes of their ſwords do repulce their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, killing their horſes as long as they may, &amp; laying on vpon the men at all places where they may finde them vnarmed. The maſe doth his office there alſo, and the Captaine Generall of the horſemen doth commaund the men of armes to keepe them ſelues firme together, and not to breake their rankes, or to ſuffer their enemies to enter within them by any meanes. Herevpon the pikemen of the Forlorne hope do ariue, &amp; the men of armes ſeeing them ariued, do make way for them to paſſe through the midſt of their rankes, and the pikes al at once do fall in amongſt the enemies, and the men of armes likewiſe vpon their flankes, and do charge altogither, and the Harquebuziers do go towards the flanckes to charge. But marke how the Lieutenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall doth ſend a companie of men of armes to charge the flancke of that Battailon, that maketh the enemie his left corner, and he himſelfe is ſodainly lighted a foote, and with thoſe that do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe his Cornet, doth giue a fight vnto one of the corners of the ſaid Battailon, who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ducteth our footmen ill in that poynt. Do you ſee how he maketh them to giue way, and how our men do begin to take heart, and do charge them ſo rigorouſly that they do repulce them? This done, the Lieutenant Generall doth mount on horſebacke againe, and his men alſo: and ſeeing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine companies of the enemies horſemen, which went to charge vpon the backes of our Battailes to put them in diſorder, hath commaunded the Hargoletiers, and Harquebuziers on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, and part of the Harquebuziers of his ſide, to go ſpeedilie toward them to reſiſt them, and doth ſend the light horſemen af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:10495:59"/>
them. Do you not ſee how our Harquebuziers on horſeback and Hargoletiers haue ſtayed them, and how they fight toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſkirmiſh? But the enemies ſeeing our light horſemen comming, and Harquebuziers at their tailes, do runne away as faſt as they can gallop. But let vs looke no more vpon that which is done on the ſides, but let vs behold the Battailons, who do fight ſo néere together, that their rankes are almoſt one vpon anothers necke: ſo that their Souldiers can very hardly vſe their ſwords, but are conſtrayned for the moſt part to fight with their daggers. Marke how the enemies are murdered, and fall by heapes, who haue nothing but pikes and ſwords, which at this inſtant do them no ſeruice, ſpecially the pikes, becauſe of the preaſe and their great length, and although that the ſword be not altogether vnſeruiceable in a preaſe, yet is it of little va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue: for that the ſayd enemies are ill armed vpon their bodies, and haue no Target or other thing to couet them from the thruſtes that our men do giue them in the faces, thighs, legges, feete, and other places vnarmed, they do therefore fall dead and maymed on euery ſide as you do ſee. Now may you ſee the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies vpon the right poynt to ſhrinke, alſo I do ſee manifeſtly that they do fall one vpon another, and that the tayle doth flye. Behold how thoſe vpon the left poynt do the like, and thoſe in the midſt alſo. Do you ſee how the Lieutenant doth ſend after them all the horſemen that are vpon his ſide, except two hundred men of armes, who do raunge themſelues againe in their firſt order, like vnto the Forlorne hope: the Pikes and Harquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers of the flanckes do alſo put foorth themſelues to followe the victorie, to giue them no leiſure to ioyne together againe, and the foure Legions do raunge themſelues in all poynts as they were before the combate: and after that the pikemen who threw downe their Pikes to vſe their Targets, haue taken them vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and amended their rankes, they march a good pace after thoſe that purſue the victorie, vntill that they do ſee that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies haue no meane left to defend themſelues, but that they do all flée, who beſt can beſt may, ſcattered like partridges. I do thinke that the retreate will ſound immediatly, if it do pleaſe the Lieutenant Generall to thinke it time. We haue gotten the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:10495:60"/>
and happely ouercome the Battaile, not hauing béen occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned to make the Halberdiers of the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> to fight, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the firſt eight rankes of pikes: neither haue we béen inforced to retire the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> within the <hi>Princes,</hi> nor to make the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries</hi> to feele of the warres: for the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> haue béen ſtrong enough of themſelues to abide the enemie his forces, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome them. Wherefore there reſteth no more to be ſpoken in this matter, but to ſhewe the reaſons that made me to raunge theſe Battailes in the manner aforeſayd, and what moued me to order the things that are happened in this Battaile, as I haue ordred them: which I will do aſwell and as briefly as poſſiblie I may.</p>

For if ſo be you would that your Ordnance ſhould ſhoote more then once, of force your enemies muſt haue as great lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to diſcharge againſt your battailes, as you haue to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge againſt theirs: which cannot be without the haſſarding of your people, vnto the daunger of the ſayd Ordnance, which may do you many great domages before you come to handie ſtrokes. Wherfore it is better that your Ordnance ſhould ceaſe his effect, then that in vſing of it your enemies Ordnance ſhould weaken you, in killing your good Souldiers: for you muſt take
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:10495:60"/>
heed of the blowes that do come farre of, being aſſured y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> through the good order that your men are in, ſo that your rankes may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borde the enemie, you ſhall eaſilie obtaine the victorie, for that your people are better practiſed, raunged, and armed then your enemies are. So that you ought to haue care of nothing ſo much as to bring your Souldiers to encounter with your enemies their rankes being whole. And for to keepe you from being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domaged with your enemies Ordnance, it would bee neceſſarie that you ſhould bee in ſuch a place whereas it might not offend you, or behind a wall or a rampar: for there is nothing elſe that might ſaue you. Yet to bee well aſſured, it were neceſſarie that they ſhould bee very ſtrong: but foraſmuch as Captaines that wil giue battailes may not be couered with walls and rampars, nor likewiſe put themſelues into places where Ordnance may hurt them: it muſt be therefore of neceſſitie, that ſith they cannot finde a meane to wholly aſſure themſelues, that at the leaſt they do finde ſome one meane which may ſaue them from being too much indomaged. And the beſt remedie that I do ſee herein, is that that I am about to tell you, which is preſently to ſeeke to hinder the vſe of the ſayd Ordnance, by aſſayling it ſpeedilie without keeping order, &amp; not ſlowlie or in troope: for by meanes of the diligence that you vſe herein, you ſhall giue them no lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to double their ſhot. And for that your men are ſcattered, it ſhall hit the fewer when it doth ſhoot: and you knowe that a band being in order may not do this, becauſe that if it ſhould march in ſo great haſt as it were neceſſarie it ſhould do, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that the rankes would put themſelues into diſorder. And if ſo be that the ſaid band ſhould be ſpred wide, the enemie might breake it eaſilie, becauſe the rankes are broken of themſelues without vſing any other force vnto them. To withſtand which perill, I haue ordred this armie after that manner that it may do both without danger: to wéete, the Forlorne hope &amp; the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuziers of the flancks, who with the Hargoletiers and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuziers on horſeback, are appoynted expreſſely for to charge vpon the enemies Ordnance, and to hinder the vſe of it: which cannot be done if that the Ordnance ſhould ſhoot alwaies, for the reaſons that I haue aboue alleadged: which is, that you cannot
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:10495:61"/>
haue that leiſure your ſelfe, and take it away from others. It followeth then, that to make the Ordnance to bee of no value, there is no other remedie but to aſſault it ſpeedilie. And if you can enforce the enemies to abandon it, then you may vſe it your ſelfe, and although they would hinder you from the vſing of it, yet they muſt leaue it behind them: ſo that being inioyed by you or troubled by them, it ſhall remaine vnſeruiceable. I conclude then, that if you will defend your battailes from the Ordnance, you haue no other remedie but to ſurpriſe it with the greateſt ſpeede that may bee poſſible. As concerning that poynt that it might ſeeme that I had guided the enemies Ordnance at my pleaſure, making the ſhot to flye ouer our footmen, I aunſwere, that great Ordnance doth oftner miſſe footmen, then touch them; for that the ſayd footmen are ſo lowe, and the Ordnance is ſo troubleſome to bee vſed, that how little ſoeuer it bee rayſed, the ſhot doth flye ouer their heads: and if it be layd a little too lowe, the ſhot liteth vpon the ground, ſo that it commeth not amongſt them. If the ground wherein they are raunged bee any thing bowing, it ſaueth them alſo, but if the place were plain, I would put the horſemen behind the battailes, chiefly the men of armes and the light horſemen, vntill ſuch time as the Ordnance were vnſeruiceable: for by meanes of their height and cloſe raung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for that they are raunged cloſer then the Hargoletiers, or Harquebuziers on horſebacke, they may be ſooner hit then foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. One thing there is, the enemies ſmall ſhot may greatly annoy vs, but we haue it aſwel as they. But to auoyd the worſt, there is no better remedie then to come to the combate, although that at the firſt aſſault there are alwaies ſome ſlaine, as ſome alwaies muſt dye at the firſt encounter, yet the perticular daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is not ſo much to be feared as the generall: for that the loſſe of fiue hundred or a thouſand men cannot bee ſo domageable, but that the loſſe of a greater troope would be more, except the loſſe ſhould fall vpon ſome of the Chiefes, and yet in ſuch a caſe wee muſt not bee too much amaſed, nor accompt the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile to be loſt: for that for the default of one principall Chiefe there are ſo many other Chiefes diſtributed and raunged in ſo good order, that the loſſe of one perticular Chiefe could
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:10495:61"/>
not be miſt ſo much as a man woulde thinke it ſhoulde be. But this buſines cannot bee done with out perill, and all being well waied our maner is the leaſt venterous that may, be ſo that you doe beginne betimes to foreſee that your enemies do not hurt you afarre of, for therin doeth the greateſt daunger lie: for as for hand blowes they may be auoided with leſſe danger, by means of armes, and good order, then thoſe that come from farre, as ſhot which nothing can reſiſt, againſt the which we muſt vſe the <hi>Switzers</hi> cuſtome, who bowing downe their heads doe runne and aſſayle the Ordnaunce whereſoeuer it bee placed, as I haue heard ſay they haue done manie times, but ſpecially at the battaile of <hi>Marignan,</hi> and they doe not refuſe battaile at anie time againſt any man whoſoeuer he be, for any doubt that they haue of the ordnaunce: but haue a law amongſt themſelues to put them to death, that ſhoulde goe out of their ranks, or ſhould make any ſhew to be afrayd of it. I haue cauſed our Ordnance to be retyred vnto the taile of our battailes after that it had once diſcharged, which I haue done to the intent that our Battai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons might haue the way free before them. And the cauſe why I made no mention of it ſince, was becauſe I thought it to bee inſeruiceable when the troupes were at it, hande to hande. I muſt heere replie in this place vnto certaine people, who iudge the Harnis that we do vſe, and the auncient order in ranging of a battaile to be vnprofitable, hauing reſpect vnto the violence of this inſtrument: for it ſhoulde ſeeme by their woords, that the men of warre of the time preſent haue found ſome better order, &amp; that they wold haue men to be ſlain or hurt at their pleaſures. Of thoſe, you ſhall fynd but few in mine opinion, but they had rather to ſhew their heeles vnto their enemies then to receyue hurt. For wherefore is it that they doe blame harnes, ſith that being naked they are ſubiect to blowes, but to the intent rather to flie then to be hurte; and to abandon their Prince at his moſt need? I would but vnderſtand why the <hi>Switzers</hi> &amp; the <hi>Almaig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> do make Battails of <hi>1000.</hi> &amp; <hi>15000.</hi> men all in one peece, after the auntient manner: and for what occaſion all the other nations haue imitated them, ſith that this forme of battaile is ſubiect vnto the ſame perill of the Ordnaunce, that the others
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:10495:62"/>
that are raunged after the auncient manner, are ſubiect vnto. I beleeue they knowe not how to anſwere this point, but who ſo ſhould aſke any Souldiour of meane iudgement, hee would anſwere, that thoſe that would not carrie Harnes, are ill coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailed: for although that Harnes be too weake to reſiſt ordnance or Harquebuſhes; notwithſtanding, it dooth defend a man from the ſtroke, of Pike, Halbard, and Sword, Croſſe-bowe, Long-bowe, and from Stones, and from all other hurt, that may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from the enemies hande, and ſometimes a Harquebuze may bee ſo ill charged, or ſo hotte, or may bee ſhotte ſo farre of, that a Harnes if it be good, may ſaue a mans life. The ſaid ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour would alſo anſwere vnto this other demaund, that men of warre doe goe ſo cloſe togeather, as wee ſee they doe: and as the ſaid <hi>Switzers</hi> and <hi>Almaignes</hi> doe, the better to reſiſt horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and to giue their enemies the more trouble to break them: ſo that we ſee that ſouldiers haue many things to feare beſides ordnance, from all which, they may be defended, by the meanes of armes, and good order: wherof inſueth, that the better that an armie is armed, and the better that the ranks are cloſed, ſo much the better it is aſſured: ſo that whoſoeuer is of the opinion aboue ſaid, is ſkant wiſe, or his conceit is not great in this matter.</p>
                     <p>Wherfore, ſith we ſee that the leaſt peece of armes which they vſed in times paſt, (which we now vſe, is the Pike) and the leaſt part of their orders, (which are the <hi>Battailions</hi> of the <hi>Switzers</hi>) doe vs ſo much good, and giue ſo great a force vnto our armies, why ſhould we not beleeue that the other armes, &amp; orders which they vſed ſhould not be profitable? ſo that if we haue a care to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend our ſelues from ordnance, placing our men cloſe &amp; ioint to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather, as the <hi>Switzers</hi> &amp; <hi>Almaignes</hi> doe, we need not doubt any other thing: as in trueth we ought to feare no order of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile ſo much as that wherein the ſouldiours are kept cloſe and ioynt togeather. Furthermore, if the ordnaunce do not diſmay vs in placing of a ſiege before an enemies towne, which may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy vs with a more certaintye, &amp; which we cannot attaine vnto, becauſe of the walles which doe defend it, neither is it poſſible in ſhort time to take away the defence of it with our ordnaunce, but that they may redouble their ſhot with eaſe: why then ſhould we be afraid of it in the field where it may be won incontinent?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="99" facs="tcp:10495:62"/>To be breefe I reſt vpon this, that the Ordnance may not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye waye hinder the Souldiers of the time preſent, to vſe the auncient maners almoſt aſwell as if there were none at all. And am alſo of opinion, that wee ought not to leaue our bodies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, although that Harneſſe cannot defend vs from Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: for (as I haue ſhewed) wee are ſubiect vnto many other more daungers then to bee hit with a ſhot of great Ordnance. To proceede, I am well aſſured that it will ſeeme that I haue ranged this Battaile, and wonne the victory at mine owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: notwithſtanding I replye heare vnto, that it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but that an armie ordered as I haue ſpoken of, ſhould ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come at the firſt encounter all other Hoaſtes, that ſhould be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as the armies are at this preſent: for the Battailons that are framed at theſe dayes, haue neuer but two or three rankes armed in the fronte, wherein the Chiefes and all the valianteſt men are imployed, not making any great accoumpt of the reſt. So that if theſe two or thrée rankes were ouerthrowne, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would make but ſmall defenſe.</p>
                     <p>Likewiſe the Battailons of our time haue no Targets, and very few Halbards or none, or if they haue any, they keepe them onely for the defence of their Enſignes, and not for to breake in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their enemies. Moreouer they are vnarmed, and therefore being at hande ſtrokes with thoſe that are ſurelye armed, and haue alſo a Target, they will eaſilye kill them, and ſo likewiſe will the Halbardiers do. In ſum, our ſaid Souldiers doe range themſelues at this day to their diſaduantage, after one of theſe two maners: that is, eyther they range their Battailes of two great a breadth, and place them one at the flanke of another, to make the front to be ſo much the larger: &amp; in ſo doing the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes are too thin, and therefore are in danger to be entered with little difficulcie, or they place them one behinde another, wherin if they haue not the cunning to ritire one band within another, &amp; to be receiued without diſorder, you may bee ſure that the hoaſt wilbe eaſile ouercome, &amp; it helpeth not that they do giue it thrée names, &amp; deuide it into thrée battailes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, into Auantgard bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, &amp; Kiergard: for this diuiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſerueth for no other purpoſe but to march on the way, &amp; to deuide the quarters for their lodgings.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:10495:63"/>
but for the giuing of Battaile this diuiſion may giue none ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, no more then if they were not deuided: for all the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of the combate dependeth vpon one of theſe thrée battailes, whoſoeuer it is that ſhall fight firſt, and according vnto the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune that that one hath, the other two doe gouerne themſelues: for if it bee ouerthrowne, the other two are diſmaide, and léeſe their hope of well dooing, and perhaps they ſhalbe brought into diſorder by thoſe that flie, retyring vnto them to be ſaued. And if ſo be that the Battaile which is firſt aſſaulted do repulſe their enemies that did charge them: yet is it but one part of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie that is ouerthrowne, for that the reſt continue in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire: ſo that it is to begin againe, as alſo it is to be doubted, that if thoſe that haue ouercome their enemies, ſhould follow them anye thing, that they ſhould bee incloſed by their other Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes in the ſight of their freends. But to proceed in our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, you haue ſeene before, how our Hargoletiers and Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſiers a Horſebacke on the left ſide of our Battailons were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed by the enemies Horſſemen, and how that they retyred vnto the Pikes of the ſame flanke. I ſay vnto you that I haue cauſed it to be ſo handled, to ſhewe wherein the Pikes of the flankes may be imployed, who are not onely appointed alwaies to keepe the ſides of the Battailons, but may ſerue for more turnes then one.</p>
                     <p>Likewiſe I haue made the men of armes to fight after that manner that I would that they ſhould fight, without breaking their order, and that they ſhould not beſtowe their labour vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men heauie laden with harnes, for that would be time loſt: but the ſureſt way is to bend at the Horſſes, who ſo will haue the men at their commaundement. And as concerning that I made them to ſtaye at the méeting, is, for that I doe thinke it to be much better then to charge running, aſwell for to continue them in good order, as to keepe their Horſſes in breath, &amp; for to haue them to be freſh at the combate. True it is I haue made them to runne all at one time, and that was becauſe that they ſhould reſiſt their enemies the better: yet it is verye harde for Horſemen to keepe their rankes how little ſoeuer theyr Horſſes doe runne, for that Horſſes are ſome ſwifter then other ſome:
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:10495:63"/>
therefore there is leſſe daunger for them to keepe themſelues firme, not ſeperating themſelues, then there is in being too for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde. Our men of armes at <hi>Rauenna</hi> did vſe the ſame order: and did eaſely ouerthrow the men of armes of <hi>Spayne.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer I haue cauſed the Forlorne hope, to put forth themſelues to ſuccour the men of armes, to the intent you ſhould know the ſeruice that this order of forlorne hope might doe, who after that they haue begune the battaile, doe range themſelues in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der either behinde or vppon the flankes; to ſerue for <hi>Subſides,</hi> vntill ſuch time as they may finde ſome occaſion to anoye their enemies. In the meane while the Harquebuſiers a horſebacke, are alwaies ſéeking to endamage their enemies. But to tel you the reaſon what moued me to make the Kinges Lieutenant ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall to light a foote; you muſt vnderſtand that in times paſte the Captaines Generalls of Hoaſts did giue order themſelues through out all the armie, whether it were to range the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes, to giue the ſignes: to beginne the combat; or to ſende the <hi>Subſides</hi> one into anothers place, and in ſome all that was done from the firſt vnto the laſt, was gouerned by their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, and hereof I can aleadge a number of examples. And yet this was not all, but if their people were at any parte diſtreſſed they ſuccoured them ſpeedelie, and lighted a foote when it was needefull, or foughte a horſebacke when as they might doe it: which was cauſe that their battailes were better fought then ours are now, foraſmuch as the Chiefes left no little peece of their office vndon, were it in playing the Chiefe or the Souldier. But theſe that are at this preſent doe thinke to doe no more after that the Battaile is once begunne then a ſimple valiant Souldier ought to doe: where as it is the parte of a good Chiefe to ouerlooke on euerie ſide what the enemies do againſt his people, to the intent to remedie all inconuences &amp; to be carefull that his people receiue no damage through his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faulte, where in it were neceſſarie that hee ſhould employe anie of his Souldiers, and ſometimes his owne perſone: yet this ought to be done as ſeldome as maybe poſſible: or if that he did fight it ſhoulde bee at an extremetie as our Captaine Generall did, who lighted to relieue a Batailon that his enemies oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:10495:64"/>
and to reſiſt the enemies force the more ſurer, you haue ſeene that one bande of men of armes did goe to charge the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies vpon the flanke, and the other bandes in the meane while haue turned their faces vnto the enemies horſemen, making ſhew to aſſayle hem to trouble them from going to ſuccour their footemen, and when hee had relieued the ſayde Batai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon hee lept a horſebacke immediatlie. And ſo likewiſe woulde I haue our Chiefe to doe, who ought to determine neuer to fight except hee were forced there vnto, but ſhoulde leaue that charge vnto them that haue no bodie to gouerne, but their owne perſones, or perticular bands, or that are not of that qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie that a Lieutenant generall is. And in ſo doing he can no waies be reproched that he hath not vertuouſly acquited himſelf of his charge although that he lay not to his hands: for it is to be thought that he aſpired not vnto that eſtate but through his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and that he hath before ſuficiently prooued himſelfe to bée a valiant, and hardie man: and therefore a Lieutenant gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ought not to be reputed for a coward although he fight not. And when all is ſaide there may more miſchiefe happen in play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hardie man then in playing the cowarde: as many aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient hiſtories doe make mention, as of <hi>Fabius</hi> the cowarde and <hi>Mutius</hi> the hardie, and of manie others, ſpecially of <hi>Monſieur de Foix,</hi> who was ſlaine through his too much hardienes, whoſe death was more hurtefull vnto the <hi>French-men</hi> then the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie that he got was profitable.</p>
                     <p>But let vs proceed and not ſtay at that which is too manifeſt: and let vs ſpeake ſomewhat of the forme of our Hoaſte: as for to ſpeake of the reſt that happened at the ende of the combat would be ſuperfluous, ſith I haue ſpoken alreadie both in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the battaile and before, of the cauſes that doe giue our men the aduantage, and the victorie, after that they doe come vnto the fight of the Sworde. I haue likewiſe taken the one halfe of our horſemen from our Batailons, to ſuccour thoſe that haue the enemies in chaſe, if paraduenture any ambuſhe ſhoulde charge them, or that the flyars would put themſelues againe to defence, &amp; ſhould repulſe them. And as concerning that I haue kept the reſt of our men of armes, and cauſed them and the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailons
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:10495:64"/>
to bee brought againe into their order, it was to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to haue alwaies the greateſt ſtrength of mine hoaſte ready to fight if ſo bee that the enemies ſhoulde ioyne together againe, or that freſhe people ſhould come vpon them: for the not doing of it, hath oftentimes happened vnluckely vnto diuers Chiefes: as vnto <hi>Coradin</hi> in <hi>Naples</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yeare <hi>1268.</hi> who thought that he had won the victorie againſt <hi>Charles</hi> the King of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> countrie, becauſe he ſawe that no man made any longer reſiſtance: but the ſaid <hi>Charles</hi> comming out of an ambuſh with freſhe men, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the others that were buſie in kiling and ſtriping of his men and ouerthrew them, and the ſaid <hi>Coradin</hi> alſo. It might ſeeme that I had not ranged our Battailons well, foraſmuch as I haue placed fiue bands in the front there in the midſt, and two at the tayle: for we might thinke that it were better to order them otherwiſe: becauſe that a Batailon is woorſt to breake when he that doth aſſaulte it doth finde it the ſtronger the further that he doeth enter into it, and it ſhould ſeeme that the manner that I haue framed ſhould be alwaies the weaker the deeper it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into, although that I doe knowe that the <hi>Romanes</hi> did appointe but <hi>600.</hi> men in their third battaile which are the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries,</hi> yet I haue put two bands into the ſaide battaile, eache of which bands hath <hi>425.</hi> men, which are <hi>850.</hi> in all, beſides the Captaines and other members, and thoſe of the flanks. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in following the <hi>Romanes,</hi> I doe rather fayle in taking too many men then to few: &amp; although that in imitating ſo good a forme as theirs is I do nether thinke to fayle nor to be reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, yet wil I giue a reaſon for it. You do vnderſtand y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the front of euerie ſquare Battailon ought to be made ſure and thick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it muſt withſtande the firſt aſſaulte of the enemies, and ſo ought likewiſe the midſt, &amp; the taile, except that they be ranged after the maner that I haue ranged theſe here ſpoken of. But to order the midſt, and the taile in ſuch ſorte; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the one may receiue the other within their ranks, it is neceſſary y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſecond which are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>Princes,</hi> ſhould be a great many fewer in number then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt which are the <hi>Haſtaries.</hi> And for this cauſe I haue put in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie ranke of <hi>Haſtaries 105.</hi> men, and in euery ranke of <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> there is but <hi>63.</hi> men, which are <hi>42.</hi> leſſe in euerie ranke.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="104" facs="tcp:10495:65"/>Furthermore, I haue appoynted the grounde that the ſaide <hi>Princes</hi> ſhould occupye in length, to bee the one halfe longer then that which the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> doe occupie: to the intent that the rankes and ſpaces that the <hi>Princes</hi> doe occupie, might receiue the <hi>Haſtaries,</hi> when as they ſhould retyre vnto them. The rankes of the <hi>Triaries</hi> are thinner, for they are but <hi>42.</hi> men in a ranke, and the place that they doe occupie in length is twiſe as long as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> doe occupie: becauſe that this laſt Battaile ſhould receiue into it the Battailes aforeſayde. Now for that it might be ſayd that how much further the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie dooth enter in, that ſo much the weaker hee ſhall finde the Battailons, becauſe that the Battailes (as I haue ſayd) are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed of people, and their rankes thinner and thinner. It muſt be vnderſtood, that in keeping of this order, an enemie can neuer fight with the <hi>Princes,</hi> vntill hee hath firſt ouerthrowne the <hi>Haſtaries,</hi> who by our diſcipline ought not to ſtaye vntill they were quite ouerthrowne. So that when as they ſhould find the enemies ſo ſtrong, that it were not in their power to make reſiſtance: I ſay that then the Colonell of the ſaid Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailon ought to commaund his Trumpet to ſound to this effect; that the King dooth commaund the <hi>Haſtaries,</hi> to retyre within the <hi>Princes:</hi> which ſound being heard, the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> ſhal retire (but not before) eaſilye, not turning their faces from their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: and to the intent that this retreat may be made without diſorder, the laſt ranke of the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> ſhall firſt retyre, then thoſe next them, and the others following. All which rankes ſhall range themſelues betwixt the rankes of the <hi>Princes,</hi> the laſt ranke of the <hi>Haſtaries,</hi> with the laſt ranke of the <hi>Princes,</hi> and ſo conſequentlye the other rankes ſhall range themſelues with the other rankes their like. And for that the rankes of the <hi>Princes</hi> ſhould not bee too thicke, I meane that thoſe that might place themſelues in their rankes ſhould do ſo, and that the others ſhall range themſelues betwixt their ranks and make new ranks: for they ſhall haue place ynough to doe it in the length that the <hi>Princes</hi> doe occupie.</p>
                     <p>If then the firſt doe range themſelues with the ſecond, and that of theſe two Battailes there is made but one: is this, to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:10495:65"/>
finde the Battailes, the further that they are entred into the weaker: for you ſee that the enemies cannot fight with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Battaile, but the firſt muſt bee ioyned with it, ſo that an enemie ſhall alwayes finde the middeſt of the Battailon ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then the front, and not weaker, foraſmuch as they ſhall now haue to deale with eight bandes, whereas before they had to doe but with fiue. And ſo likewiſe if this ſecond Battaile be forced to retire vnto the third, for an enemie ſhall not onely deale with freſh men, but with all the Legion together, for that this laſt Battaile of the <hi>Triaries</hi> muſt receiue the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> and the <hi>Princes.</hi> And for this cauſe they muſt be ranged thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and of greater length then the ſecond Battaile was: and therefore I haue made the rankes but of <hi>42.</hi> men, and their place in length twice as long as the <hi>Haſtaries,</hi> to receiue the firſt and the ſecond the more eaſier betwixt them. And if this ſpace ſeeme to be too little to receiue the eight bands, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that the rankes being in their firſt order, do occupie much more place then when they are retired: becauſe that the rankes do ſhrinke together or open when they are too much preaſed. I meane that they will open themſelues when as they will runne awaye, and when they will tary by it, they will cloſe themſelues together, to the intent not to bee opened or entered haſtilye. Moreouer if it be ſo that the enemies doe come vnto the <hi>Tria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> it muſt be thought that there are a great many ſlaine and ouerthrowne: and therefore there néedeth not ſo great place for the two firſt Battailes as if they had remained in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier. Furthermore I ſuppoſe that our ſaid <hi>Triaries</hi> will haue a good will to defend themſelues, and the others that are retyred vnto them alſo, and therefore they will occupie leſſe place: and at the vttermoſt the place is great inough to receiue the ten bands altogether; beſides that they haue the backe and wings at their commaundement. I muſt heare declare one other thing, that is, for what intent I cauſed the Forlorne hope, the Harquebuſiers a Horſebacke, and the Hargeletiers to depart with ſo great a crye when they went to aſſault their enemies: and alſo whye I made ſo great ſilence to bee kept when our Battailons approched the ſayd enemies; for it is to the matter
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:10495:66"/>
to know the cauſes of theſe two varieties, whereof many anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Captaines haue had diuers opinions: to wit, whether they ſhould haſten them in making great noyſe, or marche eaſilye without ſpeaking worde: although that this laſt maner ſerueth better to keepe order more firme, and to vnderſtand the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of the Chiefes, and the fyrſt ſerueth to kindle and heate the hearts of Souldiers. Notwithſtanding I doe thinke that we muſt haue a regard vnto both theſe things, and that it is the neceſſary that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one ſhould make as great a noyſe as they might, and that the other ſhoulde bee as ſilent as might be poſſible: for I doe not thinke that to crie continually ſhould be done to good purpoſe, my meaning is that Chiefes ſhoulde be vnderſtoode. And for to begin a battaile without crie is a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of feare, for commonlie the voice ſerueth for an index of the effect of the battaile, whereby they may hope the victorie, or miſtruſt the obtayning of it. So that I thinke that it is good that a battail ſhoulde beginne with great cries, I meane onelie at the firſt aſſault, and not after the Battailon are neare appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: for wee may ſee in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>Romane</hi> Cronicles that Souldiers which were flying haue many times tarried through the words and comfortes of the Cheifes, and haue immediately changed their order, which could not haue bin doone, if the noyſe had bin lowder then the voices of the ſaid Chiefes: or if that the crie had alwaies continued.</p>
                     <p>Touching the haſtie proceeding in the begining of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile I haue ſhewed in what manner wee ought to beginne it. Concerning the Battailons it is neceſſary that they ſhould aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault with great haſte, ſpecially if the Ordnaunce doe much indomage them, and ſometimes it will be good that they ſhould attend the comming of an enemie: to wit when as the place is vnfit, or that they might breake off themſelues not being verie ſkilfull ſouldiers. Now I doe thinke that I may paſſe further forward hauing aquitted my ſelfe reaſonably well here before of my promiſe in ſhewing the reaſons why I ranged the battai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, and gaue battaile after that manner that you haue ſeene, &amp; take in hand to ſpeake of the other poynts which are no leſſe neceſſary then thoſe aboue ſpoken of, which I will doe after that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:10495:66"/>
I haue recyted that our Legions muſt oftentimes bee exerciſed and brought together, and ranged after the manner aboue ſaid, that aſwell the Souldiers, as the officers, Members and Chiefes might know what they ought to doe. For the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in euerie bande ought to keepe their rankes well, and the officers, Members, and Chiefes to keepe their rankes in their order, and the bands well ordred; and they ſhould knowe to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Captaine Generall his commaundement, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ought to bee experte to ioyne one bande with another, and to teache the Souldiers to knowe their places readily. And to doe this with little difficultie; the Enſignes muſt bee marked to knowe who they are, aſwell for to bee there by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, as for to bee eaſelie knowne, for if ſo bee that the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes doe knowe their places and the Souldiers their places, you ſhal ſee that a Battailon wil quickly range it ſelf after that maner that it ought to be ranged, aſſoone as the Trumpet doth ſound: &amp; conſequently y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole armie aſſoone as the Lieutenant Generall, ſhal make ſigne. And this is the firſt exerciſe of foure, that an armie ought to knowe, wherein it ought to be exerciſed euerie day that it dooeth lie ſtill and many times in one day. Secondly an armie ought to be exerciſed to marche in battaile, and to keepe their rankes well, going an ordinarie pace, trot, and courſe. The thirde excerciſe is that the Battailons ſhould learne what they ought to doe vppon a day of battaile, as to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the Ordnance, and to cauſe it to be retyred, and to put forth the Harquebuſiers in the flankes, and to cauſe them to go forward with the Forlorne hope. And after that the Harquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiers haue diſcharged three or fower ſhot euerie man, running here and there without order: and although that they doe ioyne with the Pikes, and horſemen whome this charge doeth touche, yet they ſhall retire, vnto the flankes, through the ſpaces betwixt the Battailons, eache to his place: to weet the Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſiers of the flankes vnto the flanks, and the Forlorne hope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde for to range themſelues there as I haue ſaid: for if they ſhould tarrie before the Battailes, they would hinder the battai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons to fight. The Horſemen likewiſe ſhall retyre vppon the winges, and the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> muſt retyre within the <hi>Princes</hi> as if
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:10495:67"/>
they were forced: and afterwards the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Haſtaries,</hi> muſt retyre together with in the <hi>Triaries:</hi> and this done the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> ſhould retourne vnto their firſt place and the <hi>Princes</hi> likewiſe vnto theirs.</p>
                     <p>The fourth excerciſe is that euerie man ſhoulde giue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to vnderſtande the commaundement of the Chiefes, and the meaning of the ſounds of the trumpet, and the ſtrokes of the Drums: by whom ſhalbe ſignified al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhould be don in general, that is, when it ſhall be time for them to put themſelues toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in battaile, and when they ought to marche, or to ſtaye, to goe forward, or to turne their faces towards the one ſide or the other, to kiſſe the ground and to fight. Likewiſe there ſhall be ſignified by the ſayde Trumpet when it ſhall be neceſſarie to diſcharge the Ordnance, when it ſhal retire, when the Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſiers, Forlorne hope, and others, ſhould goe forward, and at what time they ſhould doe it: &amp; alſo at what time the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> ought to retire towards the <hi>Princes,</hi> and afterwards when the two Battailes ought to retyre towards the <hi>Triaries,</hi> and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye when it ſhall be time that euery man ſhould retyre from the Battaile: all which things muſt be doone by the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lieutenant Generall, and immediatly ſignified by his Trumpet: his ſounding will eaſilye bee heard by the other Trumpeters that are neereſt him, and ſo the ſounde will goe from one to another, vnto the furtheſt Trumpet in the Hoaſte. Moſt part of theſe things may bee ſignified by ſignes, without vſing of Trumpets or Drums, and likewiſe by voice, yet me thinkes that the ſounde of the Trumpet is the moſt ſureſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that euerye man cannot ſée a ſigne, but they may eaſilye heare a ſound, a voice ſometimes may be miſunderſtood, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there muſt bee good heede taken: for many times the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of the Captaines being ill vnderſtood, or ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, haue brought the hoaſts that were vnder their charge to an ill ende. Wherefore the voices or ſoundes which are ſo vſed in commaunding, in places of great daunger, ought to bee cleare and ſharpe: and bothe the ſoundes of the Trumpet and ſtrokes of the Drum, ought in themſelues to be ſo differing the one ſounde from the other, and the one ſtroke from the other,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:10495:67"/>
that the Souldiers ſhould not be deceiued in taking one thing for an other. And if ſo be that the Generall would commaund with voice, he muſt auoide thoſe voices that may be doubly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and muſt vſe perticular voices: and yet he ought not to vſe perticular voices, except they bee expreſſelye inuented for one onely thing, leaſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they might be miſunderſtood: for that a voice cannot alwayes be well vnderſtood becauſe of the noyſe of the armes, for the neighing of Horſes, for the noiſe that the Ordnance dooth make, and for the ſound of the Drum. One the other ſide a Chiefe may not alwaies helpe himſelfe with ſignes in this caſe, becauſe that darke weather, miſt, or raine, or the ſunne in mens faces doe trouble and hinder their fight, and likewiſe the changing of places if the ground be any thing bowing or couered with trées: beſides it is almoſt impoſſible to finde an expreſſe ſigne for euery thing, ſpecially for that there may oftentimes happen new matters, wherewith the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers had neuer before béene acquainted: therefore wee muſt haue recourſe vnto Trumpets as I haue ſayde, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding both ſignes and voices may be vſed in time and place. It would not be amiſſe if wee did vſe at this preſent a Cornet, or Hunters Horne for a retreate, and a Trumpet to begin the Combate or otherwiſe: for it is a hard matter that Trumpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhould make ſo many things to be vnderſtood by one onely Inſtrument, conſidering alſo that the ſounding of a retreate, is ſomewhat like vnto the ſounding to the ſtandard, ſo that when a man is troubled, and as it were beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, it is much for him to diſcerne which of the two it is that the Trumpet ſoundeth.</p>

To attaine wherevnto there is no better

meanes then to giue the foreſaide Souldiers, a good Generall Chiefe: who are ſo well inſtructed that they need nothing elſe but good conducte. Which Chiefe muſt haue had great experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the warres and muſt perfectlie vnderſtand all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntages that may be had in the excerciſe of the ſame: for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that, he deſerueth not this charge, neither can he at anie time doe anie thing ought woorth. But if he haue had this experience and beſides that bee a man of vertue, bee may then be truſted, becauſe it is moſt certaine that hee will leeſe nothing through negligence, nor hazard any thing wilfullie, but doe all in good time: and to the intent he may the better acquit himſelfe in his charge, I haue taken in hand following my pretence, to regiſter in writing thoſe thinges that I haue found heere and there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt good authors neceſſarye for the office of a Captaine Generall, and haue therevnto added certaine things of mine owne, leaſt I ſhould bee altogether found naked, if perhaps the ſayd authors ſhould come to the knowledge of their workes and take them away: which is a thing eaſie ynough to be doone, ſithe that almoſt in all places, I doe nothing elſe but tranſlate the Latin and Italian worde for worde: and haue gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether all the cheefeſt pointes that I haue found written for this ſcience, whereof I haue made certaine Chapters in forme of aduertiſements: which ſhall ſtand inſteed of remembrances, which may one daye happen to doe him ſome ſeruice, that might haue the like authoritie, if it were but to put him in mind of that he hath forgotten through diſcontinuance, or that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times his other buſineſſe appertinent vnto his charge might trouble him from looking into the depth of theſe matters. So that if anye thing ſhould happen vppon the ſudden, or whileſt he is ſo occupied, it would bee a great comfort for him to finde im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatlye a meane to helpe it, and that remedie which the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Chiefes haue vſed in like caſes. And although there may fall out inconueniences not heard of, &amp; of which there might bee no mention made neither in their bookes nor in mine: yet is it ſo, that the moſt common, and thoſe which haue happened very few wanting, are heerin contained, and the remedies alſo, and at the vttermoſt, the ſouldiours are compounded of ſo good
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:10495:69"/>

                     <p>Moreouer I do not ſee that it were greatly requiſit to ſpeake of the good qualities that a Lieuetenant Generall ought to haue in himſelfe, ſith that the King doeth ſo well knowe men that hee createth none but he hath in him all that a Chiefe ought to haue or the greater parte. But yet not to leaue this point altogether vnſpoken of, and ſo in order briefely to treat of the other thinges which he ought to know, I will name a Lord in <hi>Fraunce</hi> (with out going further) in conſidering and beholding of whoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine conditions, wee may ſee clearely all thoſe tokens to bee in him that ought to bee in a perfect Lieuetenant Generall: in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that who ſo would gouern an Hoaſt, ought to take exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of none but of him: for in my iudgement, he is ſuch a one as he ought to be, and this I may affirme, not deſeruing to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a flaterer, hauing the truth and opinion of thoſe that are of vnderſtanding on my ſide. It is the Lord Conſtable whome I doe ſpeake of, vpon whom God hath beſtowed ſo many graces, as that hee is an excellent man of warre, in time of warre, and none more readie to maintaine peace then hee: Inſomuch that me thinke, I neuer ſaw any man, that could ſo wel faſhion him ſelfe vnto both thoſe times as he dooth, and doth addict himſelfe no more vnto the one, then vnto the other, whereby wee ſee that hee reſpecteth himſelfe indifferently. And therefore God made him to bee ſuch a one as wee ought to haue, for to exerciſe the eſtate that the king hath giuen him, as it ought to be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. For hee knoweth how to make warres, for to haue peace, and to maintaine peace, for the auoyding of warres: ſo that hee fauoureth not the one, more then then the other, albeit that hee haue both in his handes, and that the Realme dooth depende whollie vpon him, becauſe of his vertue, for that hee is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with all the qualities neceſſary for the handling of both thoſe times. But let vs leaue the peace alone, hath hee not in hym all that appertaineth vnto a good Lieuetenaunt Generall, if it ſhoulde bee requiſite to make Warres?

Is he not ſproong of noble parentage, to winne the good wills of Souldiers, (if ſo be the Nobilitie of bloud may do any thing?) Is he not rich, and of great abilitie, to winne mens hearts by gifts, and by maintayning great ſtate? Is he not modeſt, ſober, painfull, wiſe, politicke, liberall, of good age, affable, wel ſpoken, a man of reputation and of renowne? Yes verely. Are not theſe the principall conditions that a Generall ought to haue, as to be temperate, to the intent that pleaſures do not diſorder him, nor hinder from following the affaires of importance that are vnder his hand; ſober, to haue his wittes at libertie to vnderſtand hard matters, for a man that giueth himſelfe to liue delicately, and to eate and drinke too much, doth dull and burie his vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that he ſhall want it when he hath need of it; painfull, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as it is neceſſarie that of all men he ſhould bee the leaſt wearie of taking paines, and be the firſt that waketh, and the laſt that ſleepeth; wiſe, and of condition to diſcourſe all his buſines in himſelfe, to the intent to foreſee, vnderſtand, or inuent a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; liberall, for by that meanes he ſhall make of his enemies his friends; of ſtraungers vnknowne, his familiars; the beſt about him will amend themſelues, if they do ſee that he doth vſe libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie towards thoſe that do good ſeruice, and ſo will the leaſt valiant alſo, which he ſhall not bring to paſſe if he were coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous and ſparing: but alſo it would be feared leaſt he ſhould bée ouercome with couetouſnes, and ſo become corrupt and diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vnto the King; of good age, that is to ſay, neither young nor old: for that the one will beléeue no bodie but himſelfe, and will be too bold: and the other is too weake, and fearefull in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of armes; affable, for there is nothing to be more diſliked in a Chief, nor that maketh him to be more hated of euery man, then when as he is troubleſome or ſtraunge to bee ſpoken vnto: on the contrarie, there is nothing more commendable in him, then to be gentle and affable vnto all men: I do meane that this affabilitie and gentlenes ſhould be moderated, and meaſured ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto mens worthines, for he muſt ſhewe a more fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaritie vnto one, then vnto another, and yet he ſhould giue all men contentment if it were poſſible; well ſpeaking, to the intent that he might perſwade his Souldiers through fayre words, to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:10495:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>
make but little accompt of daungers, for to attaine vnto great matters, and to winne all thoſe vnto him that ſhall heare him ſpeake, to be a man of reputation, and well ſpoken of. For that if he were not ſo, his Souldiers would obey him at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, euery man would find it ſtraunge to obey him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is thought to be worſe then himſelfe, or to be as little worth. It might alſo bee requiſite that he ſhould haue children, for they would bee an aſſurance vnto the realme, that he would practiſe nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, and if they be little they will ſerue for pledges, and be as it were a bridle vnto the father to reſtrayne him from the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of any thing in hand that might bee hurtfull vnto his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, yea although he had determined to do any ſuch thing: yet the affection that he beareth vnto his children wil perſwade him from it, who if they were in ſtate to carrie armes, would ſerue him with counſaile, ſtrength, and diuers other things, more faithfully then others. All which good poynts, are as I haue ſayd in the Lord Conſtable, and many others, which I do leaue to ſpeake of, whereof his deedes haue made proofe in all places where he hath béen. Wherfore, he that will make himſelfe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of the charge of a Lieutenant Generall, ought to imitate him, and to frame his Souldiers to bee ſuch, as thoſe that are ſpoken of in the firſt booke. And if he do ſo in all poynts, the king may boldly commit a good hoaſt into his hands, and referre him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe wholly vnto him for the execution of the ſame warre, except the concluding of a peace or of a truce with an enemie. For concerning the giuing of a battaile, or refrayning, the marching forward, or ſtaying, the beſieging of this towne, or that towne, and in ſumme, the handling of the warre as it ſhall ſeeme good vnto him, the king need not to trouble himſelfe; but only to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him with things neceſſarie for the maintenance of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: for otherwiſe if he would conduct the warres being out of the Campe, and a farre of, by Poſtes and meſſengers, he ſhould make his Lieutenant to be ſlow and ſlacke, in ſtead of being vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant and readie, for if he ſhould do any good ſeruice, he ſhould not carrie away the praiſe of it ſo: but that he that counſailed him thereunto would haue the better part. Furthermore, it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth nothing except the king himſelfe be moſt expert and ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:10495:70"/>
in the arte Militarie (as in trueth he is more then I can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe) if ſo bee that he would gouerne it, only by the reporte of the eſtate of his affayres: but no man can vſe it better then he that is in the field with the armie, becauſe of a thouſand ſmall poynts that muſt bee narrowly looked into, for many accidents do happen euery houre, without the ſight and vnderſtanding whereof, it is impoſſible for him to giue his counſaile, but at all aduentures. And therefore the King ſhould let his Lieutenant handle the warres according vnto his own mind, that the honor might be his owne if he did well, and the ſhame alſo if he beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued himſelfe ill: for the one would bee as a ſpurre to pricke him forward, and the other a bridle to reſtrayne him from doing any thing that he ought not to do. Notwithſtanding, the matter is vſed otherwiſe at this day in may places, for the Captaine Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls of hoaſts are appoynted the manner how they ought to gouerne themſelues: inſomuch that if there bee queſtion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue a Campe out of one place into another, or to beſiege a place &amp; aſſault it, or to fight with the enemie, or to do any other good action, they dare ſcant to do it, before that they haue giuen aduertiſment vnto thoſe that haue giuen them the charge of the hoaſt. Which manner hath béen borrowed of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and therfore their armies are called Campes of ſafetie, becauſe they ſeldome or neuer come time enough: for when as their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls haue any good oportunitie to fight, or to aſſault a towne, they looſe it, whileſt they are conſtrayned to ſend vnto the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate for counſaile, &amp; ſtay for anſwere, &amp; ſo the time paſſeth, and their enemies prouide in the meane time. If the King therefore do permit him that ſhall be his Lieutenant to vſe his own will, he ſhall bee much better ſerued then if he do limit vnto him his charge, and the ſaid Lieutenant likewiſe will not at any time do any thing but to his contentment, if the king do make choyſe of a man of the good conditions ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of before, and the ſaid Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant haue regard vnto that that ſhall be ſpoken of after that I haue ſayd ſomewhat of the matter which I left before, which to take in hand againe to procéed further, I pray the reader to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that which hath bin ſpoken of before: for it is neceſſarie for the vnderſtanding of that which followeth. For that I do

thinke the manner of raunging of an armie in battaile by me ſhewed in the firſt booke, to be better then all the other vſed vntill this day, I haue made choyſe of it. And although it bee a good and ſure manner, notwithſtanding we muſt looke if the auncient men of warre haue not vſed ſome ſingularitie in this matter, wherewith the Captaine Generall, which may haue charge of theſe Legions or of other better ordred, may helpe himſelfe at this day: and then immediatly we muſt ſpeake of certaine conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations that he muſt haue before his eyes at all times before that he do giue battaile, and all vnder one I will ſpeake of the accidents that ſometimes do happen in that poynt, and of the remedies that may bée found, for it is a matter of no ſmall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to haue the gouernment of this buſines: for although the combat betwixt two armies cannot continue much longer then two or three houres; yet the repentance of the euill gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is of too long a continuance, and of a merueilous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. Note, that of all the manners of raunging of a battaile that may bee vſed, there is none more daungerous, then to make the fronts of the Battailons broade: and by that meanes to make the fewer rankes, except you haue a great number of people, and that they likewiſe bée good Souldiers: for elſe you muſt rather make the Battailon thicke, and not too large in front, then of great breadth, and ſo much the thinner: becauſe that the thickneſſe of a Battailon is that which doth reſiſt an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie and ouerthrowe him: for the number of rankes do ſerue to amend the formoſt ranke, and to come to the combate in their places, and likewiſe to giue horſemen the more trouble to breake through them. And if the generall Chiefe haue too ſmall a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in compariſon of his enemies, then muſt he ſeeke to bring his armie into ſome place which may be inuironed on ſome ſide, either with riuer, or mariſh, or other place naturally ſtrong, and there range it in battaile, hauing a regard not to bee aſſaulted on euery ſide, nor to be incloſed. And if the place were ſuch y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> none of all theſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities might be found, he muſt then make tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches vpon the two flancks of his battailes, and behind if he will: and take this for a generall rule, that is, to enlarge or to nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe the fronts of his Battailons, according vnto the number
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:10495:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of his people, and according vnto the force of his enemies, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing alwaies regard vnto the place that he is in: for in a narrow place you muſt narrowe the rankes, and in an open place not enlarge them too much. Theſe Legions may at all times keepe one forme, for they haue their rankes ſo ordred, that they are no wider nor narrower then they ought to be; notwithſtanding the place doth rule all. But let vs put caſe that the enemies haue a leſſe number then our Generall hath, he ought then to intice them into a large and open ground, to the intent not only to haue ſcope to charge them vpon euery ſide, but alſo to ſtretch out his rankes, and order his battailes according vnto our Militarie diſcipline, which is an aduantage that he cannot haue in ſtraight and troubleſome places, for that he might not order his people vnto his will, nor according vnto their order: whereof the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> in times paſt were very carefull, and auoyded aſmuch as they might narrowe &amp; vnfit places, &amp; ſought open and large places. If ſo be that this Generall haue too fewe people, or that thoſe which he hath were not well practiſed Souldiers, he muſt do the contrarie: for then he muſt ſeeke out thoſe places that are fit to preſerue a ſmall number in, as mountaines, prouided that he might find victualls, &amp; not ſuffer want: for ſo a ſtrong coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie might preſerue a ſmall number, and he muſt alwaies make choiſe of the higher ground, to haue the better meane to offend an enemie: and bee well aduiſed neuer to plant his armie vpon the ſide of a hill, nor in any lowe ground neere vnto any bancke or hill: becauſe that the lower ground would be ſubiect vnto the enemies Ordnance, if they ſhould occupie the higher; againſt which inconuenience there could no other remedie be found but to chaunge the place and to get further of. Moreouer, he that doth order an armie to giue battaile, muſt haue a regard of the Sunne and the winde, to the intent that neither of them ſhould be in his Souldiers faces: for they would greatly hinder their ſight: to weet, the Sunne with his brightneſſe, and the winde with that it driueth before it. Moreouer, the violence of the wind oftimes is ſuch, that it doth trouble the pikemen, horſemen, and archers, that they cannot helpe themſelues with their Pikes, Launces, and Bowes ſo well as when it is calme. Imagine
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:10495:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
how they ſhould be ſerued if they had it in their faces. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> thereby loſt the battaile at <hi>Canouſe</hi> agaynſt <hi>Anniball.</hi> And as for the Sunne, it is requiſite to take heed that it bee not in the faces of the Battailons when they are readie to giue bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile: and alſo conſideration muſt bée had, that in mounting or deſcending, it do not trouble them, and therfore the Battailons muſt bée raunged at the Sunne riſing, with their backes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, and giue battaile before the Sunne ſhould decline to bée in their faces: or if the enemie had the aduantage of the Sunne in the morning, then muſt they deferre to enter into battaile vntill noone, and ſo they might haue the aduantage of the Sunne at afternoone.</p>
                     <p>This was obſerued by <hi>Marius</hi> agaynſt the <hi>Cimbres,</hi> and by King <hi>Phillip Auguſtus</hi> againſt the <hi>Flemings.</hi> If this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall had a leſſe number of people then his enemies, he might raunge them amongſt vines, and trees, and other ſuch like, as did the great Captaine of the <hi>Spanyards</hi> at <hi>Serignolle,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> were ouerthrowne. For by that meanes horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men could not hurt them, nor footmen very well; becauſe that trees, buſhes, and ſuch other like, do hinder an enemies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, without breaking their rankes, and the Generall his armie which do ſtand firme to receiue them, ſhall haue the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, ſo that the place where they are raunged bee open and plaine fourtie or fiftie paces before the battaile. It hath been ſeene heretofore, that by thoſe ſelfeſame Souldiers that Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes haue bin loſt, victories haue immediatly after bin wonne, by chaunging their order or accuſtomed manner of fight, as it came to paſſe amongſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>Carthagenians,</hi> who hauing oftimes been vanquiſhed by <hi>Marcus Regulus,</hi> were afterwards victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious by the counſaile of <hi>Xantippus</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> who only by chaunging and altering of the place, turned the fortune of the <hi>Punicke</hi> warre, and lifted them vp agayne: for he ſeeing the <hi>Carthagenians</hi> to bée ſtronger of horſemen then the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> were, and alſo to bée well accompanied with footmen, and to haue many Elephants, and notwithſtanding all this to keepe themſelues in the mountaines, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the <hi>Romanes</hi> who were ſtrong only but in footmen, kept the plaine, cauſed the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nickes</hi>
                        <pb n="119" facs="tcp:10495:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to go into the plaine, and there fought and ouercame the <hi>Romanes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Me thinke that almoſt al the auncient Captaines when they knewe that their enemies placed all their greateſt forces in one of the poynts of their armies, haue not placed before the ſayd enemies their greateſt forces; but haue offered them the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt battailes that they had, and giuen commaundement vnto their beſt forces that they ſhould only ſtand firme to reſiſt their enemies, but not repulſe them, commaunding the ſayd weakeſt battailes who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they eſteemed leaſt, to aſſay to vanquiſh their ſaid enemies, and to retyre vnto the battailes behind them. And this they did with great reaſon, knowing that this policie might bring their enemies into two great diſorders. The firſt was, that the ſayd enemies ſhould haue their beſt Souldiers incloſed betwixt their aduerſaries battailes. The ſecond was, that when they ſhould thinke to haue gotten the victorie, it would bee greatly to bee merueiled at, if their bands did not put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues into diſorder, aſwell for the victorie which they thought to haue gotten, as for to fall to pillage.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cornelius Scipio</hi> being in <hi>Spayne</hi> agaynſt <hi>Aſdruball,</hi> knowing that the ſayd <hi>Aſdruball</hi> was aduertiſed that hée was accuſtomed to raunge his <hi>Romane</hi> Legions in the middeſt of the front of his Battailes; and that hée raunged vppon the two poyntes or corners thoſe whome hée made leaſt accompt of: and that for this purpoſe <hi>Aſdruball</hi> had placed alſo in the middeſt the beſt Souldiers that hee had to make front with them vnto the <hi>Romane</hi> Legions, the ſayd <hi>Scipio</hi> altered his cuſtome vpon the day of battaile, and placed his Legions vpon the corners of his armie, and placed his light armed people in the middeſt; of whoſe force he made no great accompt. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde when they came to the fight, the ſayd <hi>Scipio</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his middle Battailons to march fayre and ſoftlie, and cauſed the two poyntes or corners to march forwarde with great diligence and haſte, ſo that the two corners of both their armies fought onely, and thoſe in the middeſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached not each other: and ſo the ſtrongeſt Battailons of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:10495:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>Scipio,</hi> fought againſt <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> his weakeſt: and the ſtou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Souldiers that <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> had, ſerued but to looke on: for the <hi>Romanes</hi> armie with their two corner battailes mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching forward, and their middle battailes retyring, were like vnto a newe Moone: by which policie the <hi>Punickes</hi> were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne.</p>
                     <p>When a Captaine Generall doth finde his Souldiers to be a more greater number then his enemies, and would inuiron his ſayd enemies vpon euery ſide before he ſhould perceiue it, he muſt raunge the front of his Battailes of the ſame breadth that his enemies are raunged: and when they come to ioyne, the two poynts or corners might ſtretch themſelues out, and inuiron their enemies, not looking for it: as were the <hi>Romanes</hi> at <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> by the Souldiers of <hi>Anniball.</hi> If a Lieutenant Generall will fight in ſafetie, and without hazarding to bee quite ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, he muſt frame his Battailons neere vnto ſome ſuch place, as might ſerue him for a refuge to retyre vnto, if ſo be that they ſhould be forced: and this refuge muſt bee at the backes of his Battailes, as ſome mariſh, or hilles, or ſome ſtrong towne: for although he ſhould loſe the Battaile, yet they could not bée vtterly put to the ſword: which aduantage his enemies ſhould not haue, but he might followe them if he thought it good. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> oftimes helped himſelfe with this foreſight after that his fortune began to chaunge, when as he had to do with <hi>Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Diuers Chiefes to bring their enemies into diſorder, haue commanded their light armed Souldiers to begin the battaile: and the battaile being begun that they ſhould retyre themſelues in the ſpaces left betwixt the Battailons, and that when the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were come to aboord one another, and the enemies atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue vnto the fight, they ſhould then iſſue out at the flanckes, and ſhould aſſault the ſayd enemies vpon the ſides of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailons. I would thinke it not amiſſe ſometimes to place a ranke of Target men before the firſt rankes of the <hi>Haſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;</hi> which Target men ſhould bee furniſhed with fire pots, balles, and other ſuch like fire workes, which they might
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:10495:73"/>
throwe amongſt their enemies, when they are approached within tenne or twelue paces one of an other. And this done, it might bee thought that theſe fireworkes would ſpoile many a man, or at the leaſt breake their order. And put raſe that this do no effect, yet it is a moſt certaine thing that the Targets will greatly anoy the enemyes Pikemen, in cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off their Pikes with their Swords, which they might do without any great daunger, becauſe of the Targets which do couer them, &amp; the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> are at their héeles to defend them: for if the Targets ſhould get vnder the Pikes, they might eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cut their throates, whileſt the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> do occupy them in fight. Concerning this matter I haue heard ſay that at the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile of <hi>Serignolle,</hi> the <hi>Spanyards</hi> with their Targets entred within our <hi>Switzers</hi> vnder their Pikes, and conſtrained them to forſake their Pikes, and to take their ſwords, becauſe the Pikes for their length might do them no more ſeruice, whereof in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, that the <hi>Switzers</hi> were ouerthrowne. It failed but a little that the like did not happen vnto our Lantſknights at the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile at <hi>Rauenna,</hi> for the <hi>Spanyards</hi> with their Targets had taken away the vſe of our Pikes, and did cut them at theyr willes, ſo that if our horſſemen had not come to their ſuccour, they had ſlaine them all. If a Lieutenant Generall had too fewe horſſemen, he might place Pikemen to backe them, and appoint that when they ſhould come vnto the fight, the horſſemen ſhould make place for the ſaid Pikemen, to the intent they might fight againſt their enemyes horſſemen in good order. And therefore the ſaid Lieutenant Generall ſhould alwayes haue a certayne number of footemen, both Pikes, and Harquebuſiers, who ſhould be practiſed (as I haue ſaid before) to fight among horſſemen: for it may ſtand him in great ſtéede, and many good Chiefes haue héeretofore helped themſelues by that meanes, and ſpecially the Harquebuſiers at this day may do great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice therein. <hi>Caeſar</hi> ouercame his enemyes in <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> by meanes of mingling footemen amongſt horſſemen. Likewiſe <hi>Scanderbeke</hi> Duke of <hi>Epire,</hi> hath woon many good victories within this 90. yeares againſt the <hi>Turks</hi> by this manner of fight. Foraſmutch as we do ſpeake of thoſe that haue found
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:10495:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
aduantages, by altering the forme of the ranging of their men in Battaile, I muſt ſay, that <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Anniball</hi> were the two moſt experteſt men in this arte in their time, or that haue béene ſince, <hi>Caeſar</hi> excepted, vnto whome, I dare attribute this commendation, that he was the beſt man of warre that euer was: and the other two were the moſt excellenteſt next him, who ſhewed theyr good wits, chiefely at that day that they fought in <hi>Africke,</hi> for which they haue been commended of euery man, and ſhall be eternally. For theſe two Chiefes being readie to giue Battaile, which they could not with honeſty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide, ordered their Armyes in theſe formes that I will ſhewe you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anniball</hi> hauing in his Army diuers Nations, placed 80. Elephants in the fronts of his Battailes, behinde whome, he placed his aydes or pertakers, and behinde them the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genians,</hi> and raunged his <hi>Italyans</hi> (whome he truſted not) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde all. He ordered them after this manner, to the intent that his aſſiſtants being betwixt his enemyes and the <hi>Carthage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> might not flye: ſo that the ſayd aſſiſtants being conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to fight, ſhould either vanquiſh or wearie the <hi>Romanes,</hi> meaning afterward to ouercome the ſayd wearyed <hi>Romanes</hi> with his <hi>Carthagenia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,</hi> who were freſh men. Againſt which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Battaile, <hi>Scipio</hi> placed his Legions after their accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med manner, and made the front full of diſtances or ſpaces left betwixt his Batailons: and to the intent that theſe ſpaces ſhould not be ſéene, but that the front might ſéeme to be furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed as it was wont, he filled the ſayd ſpaces with his <hi>Velites</hi> or light armed men, giuing them commaundement to make way for the Elephants to paſſe when the Battailes did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach néere together, and to retyre themſelues into the ſpaces betwixt the Battailles, meaning thereby that the force of the ſaid Elephants ſhould come to nothing, and it happened ſo. This done, the Battailes of <hi>Scipio</hi> came to fight hand to hand with thoſe of <hi>Anniball,</hi> and ouerthrewe them, during which combate, <hi>Scipio</hi> ioyned his <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Triaries</hi> together, and cauſed the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> to open themſelues to make way for the others to paſſe betwixt them, and placed the ſaid <hi>Haſtaries</hi>
                        <pb n="123" facs="tcp:10495:74"/>
vpon the ſides, ſeeing them to be wearyed with fighting againſt the firſt Battailes: and that the greateſt forces were yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, which were the <hi>Carthagenians</hi> themſelues, who were placed in the ſecond Battaile as is aforeſaid. And becauſe that <hi>Anniball</hi> had placed all the force of his army in his ſecond Battaile, <hi>Scipio</hi> to preſent him the like force, cauſed his <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and <hi>Triaries</hi> to come forward, for he accompted not his <hi>Haſtaries</hi> to be of that valewe that his <hi>Princes</hi> were, and in truth it was ſo: for the <hi>Princes</hi> were reputed to be more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant then the <hi>Haſtaries,</hi> and the <hi>Triaries</hi> more then the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> by this aſſembling of his thrée Battailes into one, he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrew his enemyes. This direction both in the one and the other procéeded of a very good wit. And if we at this inſtant ſhould haue warres with a people that would vſe Elephants, we might imitate <hi>Scipio:</hi> yet they are ſubiect vnto Ordnance how great and ſtrong ſo euer they be. As for the order that <hi>Anniball</hi> vſed, it might be imitated as often as we haue an Hoaſt framed of many Nations, and ſutch as we did giue no great credit vnto, but only vnto our owne. <hi>Mounſieur de Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trec</hi> (whome I may well name amongſt all the moſt excellent Chiefes that haue béen of long time) ranged his Battailes in another order, as that day that he preſented Battaile vnto the Emperour his army in the kingdome of <hi>Naples</hi> before <hi>Troy.</hi> For although that he had diuers nations in his army, as <hi>Italy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Almaignes, Switzers, Gaſcons,</hi> &amp; <hi>Frenchmen:</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to make ſhew that he miſtruſted no more the loialty of Strangers, then of the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> themſelues, made but one front of all theſe 4. or 5. Nations togethers, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the one could not ſay that he was more preferred then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, nor more kept backe, yet there were amongſt them that did require the firſt point, or to tearme it better, to make the Forlorne hope. And I heard it ſpoken that this new order (which I tearme to be new with vs, who are accuſtomed but to heare ſpeak of a Vantgard, Battaile, and Reregard) was ſutch, as the Lord <hi>Dartigue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loue,</hi> then Lieutenant to <hi>Mounſieur Negrepeliſſe,</hi> of whoſe companie I was ſometime, tolde me, and certayne other hys familier friendes, that this Battayle was raunged
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:10495:75"/>
according vnto the auncient manner, the which is the beſt and moſt ſureſt that may be, as I haue afore ſaid. And likewiſe that the aforeſaid <hi>Mounſire de Lautrec</hi> knewe well that the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whome he gouerned, had each others honour in great iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie: for the <hi>Switzers</hi> were iealous ouer the <hi>Almaignes,</hi> and the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> ouer the <hi>Italyans,</hi> and contraryly: therefore he could not haue preferred the one, without diſcrediting the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: ſo that to make his profite of the malice that was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, it was better to place them all in one front to ſée what they could do for to ſpight one another, then to vſe the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed manner: for it is no ſmall occaſion to moue Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyers withall, to tell them that ſuch haue vanquiſhed thoſe with whom they fought, or whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they feare they ſhould do it before them, had it pleaſed God that the enemyes heate had not béene ſo cooled as it ſéemed it was at that time, but that they had come out of their Fort: for through the good will that was in our men, and the good order that was aſwell amongſt the footemen as the horſſemen, it is moſt certayne that there hath not béen a battaile giuen in many a day, that had béen better fought, then that was like to do: but he that ordereth all things, had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined that it ſhould happen otherwiſe, and therefore it was not fought: but to returne to my purpoſe. Héeretofore in <hi>Aſia</hi> they vſed certayne Waggens, garniſhed with ſharp ſythes, made faſt vnto the ſides of the ſame Waggens, who ſerued not only to open a Battaile by meanes of their violence (for that the ſaid Waggens were drawne by the ſwifteſt horſſes that might be found) but alſo the ſythes were good to cut as many in pieces as they touched: which Waggens might be reſiſted after thrée manner of wayes: firſt, with ranks of the Pikes: ſecondly, by making them way through the Battailes, as hath béen ſpoken of the Elephants: and thirdly, by placing ſomewhat vpon the way that might keepe them from approching the Battailes, as <hi>Silla</hi> did againſt <hi>Archelaus,</hi> who hauing many of theſe Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens, cauſed great plants of Pine trees to be ſet in the ground behinde his <hi>Haſtaries,</hi> in the place left void betwixt them and the Princes: and ſeeing the Waggens approching neere, he gaue a ſigne that the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> ſhould retyre within y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princes,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:10495:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>
who being retired, were out of danger to be ſlaine with the ſaid ſythes, and the Waggons were ſtayed from approching the Battailes. Moreouer vpon the ſame day <hi>Silla</hi> inuented a new manner of ranging of an Hoaſt, for he put all his light armed men behinde his Battailes, and left many ſpaces betwixt his ſaid Battailes for them to paſſe through to go forward as often as it ſhould be needfull. And when the Battaile was begun, he cauſed his light armed men and his horſſemen to come forward to charge his enemyes, who being out of their courſe becauſe their Waggons were repulſed, were broken, and ouerthrowne in ſhort time. There is yet many other formes to be vſed in the ranging of a Battaile, of which I will ſpeake as the matter will leade me therevnto, not ſtaying otherwiſe: to the intent to ſpeake in few words a little of euery thing that concerneth this diſcipline, and that which is néedfull to be knowne, for to haue ſeruice of theſe Legions ordered as I haue ſhewed, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie that I ſhould ouerpaſſe them all briefely, and yet not ſo briefely as to leaue thoſe points vnſpoken of that ought to be touched, or at the leaſt the moſt neceſſaryeſt: therefore I will begin with thoſe things that ought to be done during the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, and will ſpeake of other things that may trouble and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage an enemy whileſt he attendeth for the Combat.</p>
                     <p>A Generall Chiefe may cauſe a voice to be giuen out, that he hath a new ſupply of men comming vnto him, and may make a ſhew of ſome matter like a truth, that may ſignifie his ſuccour to be neere, and it may happen that through this bruite, his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemyes would be diſcouraged at the likelyhood of the ſayd ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, and being diſcouraged, he might ouerthrowe them with little difficultie. <hi>Minutius Rufus,</hi> and <hi>Acilius Glabrion,</hi> two <hi>Romane Conſuls,</hi> helped themſelues with this ſubtletie. <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitius</hi> put all the ſeruants and labourers of his Hoaſt vppon Moyles and other Beaſts, vnfit for fight, cauſing them to be ranged in ſutch ſort that they ſéemed a farre off to be a great number of horſemen, whome he ſent vp vpon a Mountaine ſomewhat neere vnto his enemyes Campe, commaunding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to kéepe themſelues cloſe, vntill the Battaile was begun, and that then they ſhould ſhewe themſelues in many troupes like
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:10495:76"/>
horſemen, faigning to come downe vpon the <hi>Gaules,</hi> who thinking that certayne newe bands had come vnto the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> retyred notwithſtanding that they were in a good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes to get the victorie: whereby we ſee, that faigned aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults do helpe to amaze enemyes while they are in fight. And therefore it may be thought that the aſſault that might be giuen them in good earneſt, would do mutch more ſeruice, ſpecially if they were giuen vpon the flanks or behinde at vnwares, when the fight is at the hoteſt. Truth it is that this can not be done but very hardly, except the ground be very fit for the purpoſe, for if the countrey be plaine and open, it will be impoſſible to hide your people in any place, which is a thing neceſſary in ſuch like enterpriſes: for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground muſt be bowing, or full of buſhes &amp; hedges, or otherwiſe fit for the purpoſe, in which places the Generall might lay part of his people in ambuſh to iſſue out, and ſodainly aſſault his enemyes, not giuing them leiſure to prouide for it. And this muſt be handled ſo ſecretly, that his enemyes do not perceiue it: for if the ſaid ambuſh do wiſely execute their enterpriſe in due time, it ſhall neuer fayle to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine victorie. This manner of warre did <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> oftimes vſe againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> who hath ouerthrowne more <hi>Turks</hi> with his ambuſhes, and ſurprices, then any other Prince that I do knowe, how great a number of people ſo euer he hath had. It hath ofttimes ſerued to good purpoſe, to giue out a voyce during the Combate, that the Captayne Generall of the enemyes is ſlayne, or to encourage ſouldyers with crying that they haue the victorie. An enemyes Horſe may alſo be troubled with horrible ſights, and vnaccuſtomed noyſe, which policie <hi>Craeſus</hi> vſed, placing Camels before his enemyes horſſemen, and <hi>Pirrhus</hi> placed Elephants before the <hi>Romanes</hi> horſemen, the ſight whereof ſo feared and diſordred their horſſes, that they could not be maiſters of them. <hi>Semiramis</hi> cauſed many artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Elephants to be made, which repreſenting naturall Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plants, put the horſemen of <hi>Staurobates</hi> King of <hi>India</hi> to flight, becauſe the horſſes were feared with that newe ſhape, and with a ſmell that was contrary vnto the Elephants that they had béen accuſtomed vnto. It is not long ſince, that the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:10495:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>Turke Soltan Selim</hi> ouerthrewe the <hi>Sophy</hi> in <hi>Perſia,</hi> and the <hi>Souldan</hi> in <hi>Siria,</hi> principally with the noyſe of the Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſery, which was a thing that they had not bin accuſtomed vnto, and therefore ſo ſkared their horſſes, that it was not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to kéepe them in order to fight, but did put them to flight incontinent, he that beſt might faſteſt. The <hi>Spanyards</hi> to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh the army of <hi>Amilcar,</hi> placed before their Battails diuers Waggons full of light wood and brimſtone, which were drawne by Oxen, and when the battailes approched, they put fire into their Waggons, wherevpon the ſaid Oxen to flye from the fire which they perceiued at their tailes, thruſt into the battailes of <hi>Amilcar</hi> ſo forceibly, that they opened them, and put them in diſorder. An enemy may be deceiued, if in fighting he may be brought vnto an ambuſh, as is aboueſayd. But if ſo be that the countrey be not fit for ambuſhes, there may be diuers great ditches made, which may be couered with buſhes, and earth lightly layd ouer agayne, and certaine firme places be left betwixt the ditches, with good marks for to finde them, at which places thoſe may retire that are ſent to charge their enemyes, faigning to be afrayd in their returning backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, to cauſe their enemyes to follow them the faſter, and to fall into the ſnare. A King of the <hi>Etheolytes,</hi> which are a people neere vnto <hi>Perſia,</hi> vſed this policy againſt <hi>Peroſas,</hi> King of <hi>Perſia.</hi> The <hi>Egyptians</hi> alſo at a day of Battaile, hauing certaine quagmyres néere them, couered the ſaid quags with an hearbe called Alga, to hide the euill places from the ſight of their enemyes, and when the battaile began, the ſaid <hi>Egiptians</hi> faigning to flye, retyred vnto the quags, and paſſed through at certayne ſure paſſages, and theyr enemyes who purſued them in great haſte, ſoonke into the myre vp to the throates, and ſo were ouerthrowne. <hi>Viriatus</hi> did as mutch againſt the <hi>Romanes.</hi>

                     <p>If any accident ſhould happen vnto the Generall during the combat, which might diſmay his ſouldiers, it is a point of great wiſedome to couer it, and to make the beſt of it preſently: as <hi>Tullius Hoſtilius,</hi> who ſeeing that his aſſiſtants whiche ought to enter battaile with him, went theyr wayes without
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:10495:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſtriking ſtroake, and that their departure would haue greatly diſmayed his ſouldyers, cauſed it to be giuen out through all his Hoaſt, that they went away by his commaundement, which did not only apeaſe his people, but did moreouer ſo incourage them, that they were victorious. The like did <hi>Silla</hi> when a great part of his horſemen forſooke him. And another time when as he had ſent certaine of his aſſiſtants into a place where they were all ouerthrowne and ſlaine except one perſon, fearing leaſt his Army ſhould be diſmayed, ſayd incontinently that it was done by his owne will and counſayle, becauſe they had conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againſt him, and that therefore he had ſent them vnto that place to diſpatch them, to preuent their miſchiefe. <hi>Sertorius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Spayne</hi> in battayle againſt his enemyes, ſlew a meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that brought him word of the death of one of his Captains, doubting that this newes ſhould haue diſcouraged, and taken away his ſouldyers good wills for to fight. <hi>Titus Didius</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing loſt many of his people in battaile againſt his enemyes, who on both ſides had giuen ouer, not knowen who had the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to hide the loſſe he had ſuſtained, cauſed all the night long his dead men to be caryed away, and to be buryed: the next day his enemyes ſeeing a great number of dead men on their ſide, and very fewe of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> imagining thereby that they were greatly weakened, forſooke the place, not offering battaile any more. It is a hard matter to ſtay and to bring an Army backe againe vnto the Combat when it is fleeing, I meane, if they be all in going: but if it were but part of them, there might then ſome remedie be found, and ſutch a remedie, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Captaines haue helped themſelues withall héeretofore, which hath béene, to place themſelues before thoſe that fledde, ſhewing them the danger and ſhame that doth follow a flight. Of which Captaines was <hi>Silla,</hi> who ſeeing that a great part of his Souldyers chaced by <hi>Mithridates,</hi> had turned their backs, got before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with his ſword in his hand, and vſed theſe words vnto them in a lowde voice, as in reproach: You <hi>Romane</hi> Souldyers that flye away, when you are returned vnto your Citie, if any man do aſke you where you haue left your Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, aunſwere them that you forſooke him in <hi>Boetia</hi> fighting
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:10495:77"/>
againſt his enemyes. <hi>Attilius</hi> the <hi>Conſull,</hi> ſeeing that a great part of his army did fight valiantly, and that another part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to flye, tooke thoſe that made no ſhew to flye, and placed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt thoſe that were flying, ſaying vnto them, that thoſe that would not returne againe vnto the Combate, although they had eſcaped their enemies ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, ſhould not eſcape their friends. <hi>Phillip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> knowing that his ſouldyers fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red greatly the <hi>Scithians,</hi> againſt whome he was conſtrained to fight, appointed that a great number of his beſt horſſemen, and thoſe whome he truſted moſt vnto, ſhould be placed vppon the wings and taile of his battailes, commaunding them to kill all thoſe that would make any ſhew to turne their backs: whereof his people being aduertiſed, choſe rather to abide the aduenture of the Battaile, then to truſt vnto the flight, and by that meanes ouercame them. The <hi>Romanes</hi> not only to ſtay a flight, but alſo the more to animate their ſouldiers in the fight, haue ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taken their Enſignes from thoſe that carried them, and thruſt them forward into the thickeſt preaſe of their enemyes, who remembering the ſhame and puniſhment that might come vpon thoſe that ſhould ſuffer their Enſignes to be loſt, haue fought manfully. At other times it hath happened that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Conſuls</hi> ſéeing their Enſignebearers to march too ſlowly &amp; coldly againſt their enemyes, haue cauſed them to be ſlayne vpon the place, and if it chaunced that all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> army did flye before their enemies, they did then ſhut the gates of their Camp, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that no ſouldier ſhould enter before they had vanquiſhed their enemies, which cauſed them to re-enter in battaile, and to begin the Combat in better order. I do héere remember my ſelfe ſomewhat as touching the forme of ranging of an army in battaile: there haue bin heretofore Captaines that haue ranged their battailes in point, that is to ſay, narrow and ſtrong, their chiefeſt forces before, thinking by that meanes to open the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Hoaſt the eaſier, againſt which manner, hath bin inuented a forme of battaile like vnto a paire of ſheares, or forke, for to receiue the ſaid point and to enuiron it, and to fight with it vpon euery ſide: in which caſes, this generall rule muſt be vſed, that is, that the greateſt remedy that a man may find againſt his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:10495:78"/>
pretence, is to do that voluntarily which he ſhall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to do, for that doing it voluntarily, it may be done in good order to his aduantage, and vnto the preiudice of his enemies, whereas if he be enforced to do it vpon an extremitie, it will be his manifeſt perdition. And to verifie this, I muſt repeate cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine things ſpoken of before, if our enemy do make the head of his battailes ſharp and ſtrong before, to open our battailes, and that we attend, or aſſayle him, hauing ours open, we are ſure to put our enemies into diſorder without any doubt, and they ſhall not be able to put our men to any foyle. To proue it to be true, <hi>Anniball</hi> placed Elephants in the front of his army, to open <hi>Scipio</hi> his Battailes, which <hi>Scipio</hi> marching with his Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes open, did thereby ouerthrow him. <hi>Aſdruball</hi> placed the beſt ſouldiers that he had in the middeſt of the front of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, for to enforce <hi>Scipio</hi> his men, but <hi>Scipio</hi> commanded that they ſhould retyre of themſelues, and ſo ouercame them: ſo that we do ſée that an enemy may be fruſtrated of his imagination, when as we do prouide for it betime, and when as we do that voluntarily which we thinke we muſt do either by force, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie.</p>

reſt after that he had the victory, but followed his enemies more fearcely after that he had broken their forces, then he did aſſault them being in their intier. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a battaile is loſt, a Captaine Generall muſt ſée if by his loſſe he may not haue a meane to hurt his enemies, &amp; to repaire his loſſe, ſpecially if he haue any people left to do it withall. The oppertunitie may be giuen through the ſmall care that an enemy hath oftimes after a victory, for that many times he doth become negligent, hauing no care of watch, nor regard of being ſurpriſed: wherfore a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Generall may then haue meanes to repaire his loſſe, as did <hi>Martius</hi> the <hi>Romane,</hi> after that the two <hi>Romane</hi> armies were ouerthrowne, &amp; the two <hi>Scipios</hi> dead, who ouerthrew the <hi>Carthagenians</hi> at that time they thought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be moſt ſureſt, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they doubted not that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> remnant of two van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed hoaſts durſt aſſault their vanquiſhers: ſo that (through the great truſt that they had in their owne aſſurance) they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to kéepe good watch the night following, in which the ſaid <hi>Martius</hi> aſſailed &amp; ouerthrew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for euery man knoweth that there is nothing ſo eaſy to be brought to paſſe, as that which an enemy thinketh dare not be put in practiſe, and they do oftimes take hurt on that ſide that do leaſt looke for it. And if a Captain Generall could not help himſelfe by this meanes, becauſe of the vigilancie of his enemies, yet he muſt ſtudy to make his loſſe as little domageable, as he may poſſible. Which to do, it were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould handle the matter ſo that his enemies might not follow his men, nor ouertake them flying from the battaile, but finde ſome policy to hinder his ſaid enemies vpon the way. As concerning the flying without being followed, or being fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed not to be ouertaken, &amp; vtterly ouerthrowne, he muſt imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the example of <hi>Sertorius,</hi> who being vanquiſhed by <hi>Metel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> knowing that it would but little auaile him to flye away, commaunded his Captaines &amp; men of war, that they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre vnto diuers places, as ſkattered &amp; diſperſed as they might poſſible, hauing before aduertiſed them of the place where they ſhould all méet together againe. <hi>Viriatus</hi> did as much. In our time hapned almoſt the like amongſt the <hi>Spanyards</hi> which reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from <hi>Marcellus</hi> in great diſorder, who hauing the King
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:10495:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
at their tailes, knowing that he made haſte to cut off their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages to arriue at <hi>Milan</hi> before them, and to inioy all the ſtrong townes of <hi>Italy,</hi> could not imagin a better remedy to helpe it, then to name the places vnto which euery man ſhould retire, and to diſpearſe themſelues diuers wayes for the ſpéede &amp; ſafety of their iourney, for all the countrey was full of French ſouldy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: but what one way and other, they did ſo get through, that they aſſembled at the townes that were appointed them by their principall Chiefe, and there made themſelues ſtrong, namely, at <hi>Lodes, Pauie,</hi> and <hi>Cremona,</hi> which was the cauſe that we could not recouer the Duchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> but receiued diuers loſſes. This aduertiſement might ofttimes be giuen before the beginning of a Battaile, if it were thought that the end of the Combat might happen to our loſſe: but this aduertiſement might be giuen vnto the principall Chiefes that haue the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt authoritie in an Hoaſt, who afterward might aduertiſe the Captaines when as they do ſée no likelyhood of victorie, and not before: and thereof might this profit enſue, that is, that the Generall of the enemyes doubting to deuide his army, might ſuffer either all or the greateſt part of the vanquiſhed to eſcape. Furthermore, to ſtay an enemy that ſhould follow thoſe that flye, he might caſt his gold and treaſure in the way as he flyeth, and it is ſure that the enemyes will ſtay to gather it vp, and in the meane while his army may haue time to eſcape, and to win ground of them. By this meanes haue diuers Princes &amp; great Captaines helped themſelues, and amongſt others, King <hi>Mithridates,</hi> to eſcape from the hands of <hi>Lucullus,</hi> and <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi> King of <hi>Siria,</hi> to eſcape from the hands of <hi>Antiochus. Frotho</hi> King of the <hi>Danes</hi> being landed in <hi>England,</hi> did as mutch to deceiue the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> that purſued him, who were ſo laden with the baggage of the <hi>Danes,</hi> that when they ſhould haue defended themſelues being aſſaulted, they were ſcattered héere &amp; there to gather vp the ſpoiles that the <hi>Danes</hi> left behind them, ſo that the <hi>Danes</hi> had as good a match at their hands as they did deſire, and ſlew them at their pleaſures. It reſteth yet if I do well remember my ſelfe, to ſpeake of the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that a Captayne Generall ought to haue, before that
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:10495:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he come ſo farre as to giue battaile: for I haue promiſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſpeake ſomewhat thereof. Vnto which point I do ſay firſt of all, that a Captaine Generall ought neuer to hazard a Battaile, except he ſée an aduantage, or that he be conſtrayned therevnto. The aduantage procéedeth of his enemyes wéery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ill ordering of his Battailes, of the hauing of a greater number of people, then the ſaid enemy hath, or of the hauing of better ſouldyers. The conſtraint procéedeth of an aſſurance that we haue to léeſe if we fight not: as if ſo be that the want of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſhould cauſe an army to breake, or if ſo be that the aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants ſhould force the ſaid Generall for to hazard the battaile, as it hapned vnto <hi>Mounſieur de Lautrec</hi> at <hi>Bicocque,</hi> where the <hi>Switzers</hi> being the ſtrongeſt, enforced him to fight with the <hi>Spanyards,</hi> and to aſſault them in their fort, threatning the ſaid Lord, and proteſting that at that very inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t they would returne into their countrey, if ſo be that he gaue not battaile. And héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they did ſo greatly importune him, that he was forced to yéeld vnto their wills, and to fight at his great diſaduantage: at which time he was repulſed, and conſequently chaſed out of <hi>Italy.</hi> It is alſo requiſite to hazard a battaile when an army is in danger of a preſent famine, or that the enemyes do looke for a new ſupply within ſhort time: in ſuch a caſe a Generall ought to giue battaile, although that the aduantage be not on his ſide, for it is better to try if fortune would fauour him any thing, then not trying it, to abide the arriuing of his ruyne. And a Lieutenant Generall deſerueth as great a check when he falleth into theſe inconuenients, as if he had a fit opportunitie to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh his enemyes, and had not knowne it through his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or had loſt it through his ſloath. Theſe aduantages are ſometimes offered by an enemy, and ſometimes our owne wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome doth giue vs them. The aduantages which an enemy doth giue, are after diuers manners, as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are ſeparated, &amp; far diſtant one from another, hauing their enemyes neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: as were the ſouldyers of the Duke <hi>Deſtoutuille</hi> vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day that they were ouerthrowne at <hi>Adrian:</hi> for the Auantgard &amp; the greateſt part of the army were ſo far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the battaile &amp; the Arriergard, that they could not be aduertiſed in time to returne
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:10495:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to ioine themſelues together: wherefore being ſeparated ſo far off, the <hi>Spanyards</hi> made of them what market they would. A Lieutenant Generall doth likewiſe cauſe his owne ouerthrow, when he doth ſend any part of his people out of his Camp, lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them far off in weake places at the mercy of his enemyes: for there néedeth no man but the enemyes to knowe of it to cut their throates, as it happened vnto <hi>Mounſieur Bayard,</hi> at <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bethe,</hi> who lay there vnfortified by the commandement of the Lord Admirall <hi>Bonniuet,</hi> looking euery houre whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the enemies ſhould aſſault him, which they did in the end, &amp; ſlew both him &amp; his. It hath many times hapned that an army hath béen ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne in paſſing ouer great riuers, through the good aduiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Captaine Generall, who hath ſtaied vntill the one halfe hath bin paſt, &amp; afterward hath charged vpon that part y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſtood beſt for his hand, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> did againſt the <hi>Switzers,</hi> being come downe alongſt the riuer of <hi>Sone,</hi> where he ſtaied vntill 3. parts of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were paſt, &amp; after charged vpon the fourth that was behind, &amp; ouerthrewe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the others by no meanes able to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Sometime an enemy doth ouer-trauaile himſelfe, at which time if he ſhould aſſault vs being freſh &amp; reſted, we ought by no meanes to let this oppertunitie to ſlip, for we ſhould haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as good cheape as we would our ſelues, as the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> had the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> at the battaile of <hi>Creſye.</hi> Moreouer, a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall may ſpend a good part of the day before his iſſuing out of his Camp, when he thinketh that his enemies haue bin long ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and after that they haue loſt their firſt heate. This manner did <hi>Scipio</hi> &amp; <hi>Metellus</hi> vſe in <hi>Spaine,</hi> the one againſt <hi>Aſdrubal,</hi> &amp; the other againſt <hi>Sertorius.</hi> A Captaine Generall may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hazard y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Combat, if he knew that his enemies haue dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed his hoaſt, as did the <hi>Spanyards</hi> in <hi>Nauarre</hi> againſt the Lord of <hi>Eſpattez,</hi> or that he had diuided the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as the two <hi>Scipios</hi> did in <hi>Spaine,</hi> wherby they were ouerthrowne &amp; ſlaine. We did likewiſe weaken our hoaſt at <hi>Pauy,</hi> to ſend vnto <hi>Naples</hi> &amp; other places, which was cauſe that the enemies did the bolder aſſault vs, &amp; that we were ſo much the weaker to defend our ſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. A wiſe Captaine ought rather to reſiſt the viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his enemies, then to aſſault them furiouſly: for fury is eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:10495:80"/>
by faſt &amp; ſure men, and if it be once withſtoode, the reſt is nothing, both becauſe they do put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues out of breath, &amp; alſo their battailes out of order, how little ſo euer they martch haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as alſo for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the firſt heat doth coole, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they ſée y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the attendant to be other then they loked for before. By the meanes of this patience in ſtaying to receiue the enemyes army without ſtirring foot, did <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> ouercome y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

when <hi>Pompey</hi> fought againſt the <hi>Iewes.</hi> The wiſeſt point that a Captaine Generall can do, is to kéepe a good number of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men commonly about him, who are wiſe &amp; expert in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> feats of the wars, with whome he may conſult at all houres, &amp; confer with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> touching his owne force and his enemyes: to diſcerne whether of them hath the greateſt power, beſt ſouldiers, beſt armed, and beſt practiſed men, or which of their two armyes can beſt abide the extremities of the warres. Likewiſe he ought to debate with his ſaid counſaile whether he might truſt moſt, vnto his horſemen, or vnto his footemen, and whether it were for his moſt aduantage to put himſelfe in the plaine, or to keepe the hills. Furthermore, whether the place that he is in be of more aduantage for him, then for his enemyes, and to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whether of the two armyes may be moſt commodiouſly victualled, and whether it be good to defer the giuing of battaile, or to come to the fight immediatly, &amp; what aduantage the time may either giue or take: for many times when ſouldyers do ſée the warre prolonged, they waxe diſcontented, and therefore being wearied with paines and griefe, and moued with a deſire that they haue to returne vnto their owne houſes; they might be like ynough to forſake the Camp, and to goe their wayes. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all things he ought to knowe the Captayne Generall of his enemyes army, and what people he hath about him, and ſeeke to vnderſtand whether he be raſhe or warie, a coward, or valiant, and whether his men be new ſouldyers, or hardened, and with what enemyes they haue had to do, and whether the ſaid enemyes were men of warre or not. Furthermore, the ſaid Lieutenant ought to conſider whether he may repoſe his moſt truſt in his aſſiſtants &amp; other ſtrange ſouldyers, or in his owne countreymen, and conſider in which of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is the greateſt likelyhood, and if ſo be that he ſée his Hoaſt diſmaied, or out of hope to vanquiſh their enemyes, he ought then to haue the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt care that may be not to giue battaile: for the greateſt token that may be of the loſſe of a battaile, is, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as ſouldiers haue a conceipt in themſelues that their enemyes cannot be ouercome.

who alwaies placed his Camp in ſtrong places, which was the occaſion that <hi>Anniball</hi> had neuer the heart to aſſaile him. And when a Captaine Generall doth doubt that his enemie hath ſo great power that he might, or would aſſaile him in his trenches, there is no better remedie for him then to leaue the field, and to retyre his men into ſtrong Garriſons, parting his bands ſome one way and ſome another: to the intent that the trouble of the beſieging of many townes and ſtrong places, might wearie his enemies, ſo that they ſhould bee conſtrayned to looſe their time altogether, or at the leaſt he himſelfe haue reſpit to ſtrengthen himſelfe to go againe into the field when he ſhould ſee time, or elſe I do not thinke that it were poſſible for a Chiefe to auoyde the battaile (whatſoeuer ſhould happen) if ſo be that his enemies had will for to fight: except he kept himſelfe alwaies twentie or thirtie miles from them, to the intent to haue time enough to raiſe his Campe before his enemies comming, if ſo bee, that they would aſſault him, as did the aforeſayd <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> in keeping himſelfe farre from <hi>Anniball.</hi> And although that the diſtance was not aboue twentie or thirtie miles, yet the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie was ſo fit for to auoyd the combat, that if ſo bee he would haue fled he might haue done it, although he had been hard fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, which <hi>Fabius</hi> neuer ment to do: for he did not ſo much auoyd the combat for the feare he had of his enemies, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayne them to aſſault him in his fort at their diſaduantage, or to wearie them in deferring to come to the combat, and thereby to conſtrayne them to abandon the countrie, or at the leaſt to keepe themſelues the cloſer together, and to make leſſe ſpoyle and waſt of the countrie, then if he had left them alone. And on the other part, <hi>Anniball</hi> (through his obſtinacie) attended to vanquiſh the <hi>Romanes</hi> patience, vntil ſuch time as they ſhould come downe into the plaine to fight with him, putting his men in greater daunger, then if he had tried to vanquiſh <hi>Fabius</hi> by aſſaulting him in his fort with the loſſe of a fewe men.

                     <p>IT is a great poynt of wiſedome to deferre the comming to battaile, when as a man is aſſayled in his owne countrie, his enemies hauing better ſouldiers, and a greater number then he hath: for if the battaile ſhould be loſt through the aſſayling of them, the countrie would be in hazard to be loſt. The example of the laſt King of <hi>Hungarie</hi> may proue it to be true, who being aſſailed (in the yere 1526.) by the <hi>Turke</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> raigning, thought it better to hazard the battaile and to fight with the <hi>Turkes</hi> at their ariuall, then to forbeare and to ſtand vpon his guard; which was cauſe that he himſelfe was ſlaine, and his kingdome loſt. Wherefore, the ſureſt way is to make a defenſiue warre in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding for the townes that are vpon the frontiers, &amp; to cauſe the victualls to be ſpoyled y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> cannot be brought ſafely away: &amp; this doing our enemies ſhalbe famiſhed, or conſtrained (if they do not

retire) to ſeeke to fight with vs, how greatly ſoeuer it be to their diſaduantage. And we ſhalbe at choyſe to accept or to refuſe the battaile, as we ſhal ſee it to be for our aduantage. As concerning this poynt of forbearing an enemie, &amp; wiſely defending of a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie: I cannot alleadge a more freſh example, then the manner that was obſerued by the Lord Conſtable in <hi>Prouince</hi> againſt the Emperour: for after that he had well furniſhed the townes vpon the frontiers, that were defenceable, and thoſe that might hinder his enemies comming forward (if ſo bee that they would haue entred farre into the countrie) hauing cauſed all the milles and ouens to be ſpoyled, &amp; the corne and fruite to bee deſtroyed that could not ſafely be carried away, and likewiſe the wells and ſprings to be corrupted: the ſayd Lord Conſtable made himſelfe ſtrong in <hi>Auignon,</hi> and there determined to attend to receiue the <hi>Switzers</hi> and other Souldiers that came for to ayd him, and alſo the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of his enemies if they had will for to fight with him, which act was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended both of the one ſide &amp; the other, for the moſt ſureſt counſaile that might haue béen vſed at that time: conſidering the force of our enemies, and how ill accompanied the King was, and that the warre was ſtirring in many places within his countrie: therefore to deceiue the Emperour his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence (for he made his accompt to haue had a better match at our hands at home in our owne countrie then abroad) it was the beſt remedie that might haue béen thought vpon, not to fight at the firſt ariuall, nor at the will of the ſayd Emperour: but to ſuffer him to coole, &amp; to weaken himſelf of men, victuals, &amp; mony: whileſt the ſaid Lord Conſtable did make himſelfe ſtrong of all things neceſſarie, attending for a time conuenient to make him to knowe in what daunger he putteth himſelfe that entreth into another man his countrie, with a wrong conceipt: which daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger (to ſay trueth) is greatly to bee feared. As for me I would neuer be of the opinion to aſſaile a Prince in his countrie, that is ſo mightie and ſo well obeyed, as the King of <hi>Fraunce</hi> is, what reaſon ſoeuer is alleadged vnto the contrarie. As for to ſaye that hée that doth aſſayle hath many aduantages vpon his ſide, I finde that he that is aſſayled hath many alſo vpon his ſide: and it little auayleth that ſome maintaine, that thoſe
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:10495:83"/>
that aſſaile haue more courage then thoſe that are aſſailed: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that this may ſometimes bee true, yet is it not alwaies ſo, for a Generall may embolden his men many waies, to make but little accompt of thoſe whom they feared at the firſt. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, the iuſt and holie quarrell that bindeth euery man to defend his countrie, may be layd out before them; which is a thing that hath a more force in it, then the deſire or hope of the enemies to be rich by other mens goods. And if wee will ſay that a Prince that doth aſſault another, doth take from his enemies the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie which he had before of the aſſiſtance of his ſubiects, for that the countrie will bee deſtroyed, and his ſubiects; ſo that hée may be no more aſſiſted by them: it may bee aunſwered, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goods be loſt, yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loſſe of goods doth not alienate, nor turne the peoples hearts from the affection that they beare vnto their naturall Prince. But it is an occaſion to roote them in it more and more, and to ſtirre them vp and hearten them agaynſt thoſe that haue endomaged them, ſo that one of thoſe that haue loſt their goods, are worth foure of them that haue loſt nothing, or that make warres for their Princes perticular quarrell. Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man knoweth what domage thoſe of <hi>Prouince</hi> did of late vnto the <hi>Spanyards,</hi> that ſpoyled them, which domage had not béen ſo great, if they had not miſuſed the countrie people, or had not béen the occaſion of the deſtroying of their fruites that could not be ſaued. As for to ground vpon that, that a Prince which is aſſaulted, is conſtrayned to haue the greater regard in taxing of his ſubiects, or in commaunding them to do any thing, leaſt his people ſhould refuſe or denie to do it, vpon the hope they might haue to ioyne with his enemies, if their ſayd Prince ſhould miſuſe them, or neuer ſo little threaten them, is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that may be reſolued in one word: to weet, that this aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance cannot bee taken from a Prince, except that he do léeſe all his lands and all his friends, for otherwiſe he ſhall be ſuccoured in deſpite of his enemies, as appeareth by the ſuccour that the Kings of <hi>Fraunce</hi> haue had of their ſubiects at all times: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that the <hi>Engliſhmen, Nauarrians,</hi> and a great number of the Princes of the realme were almoſt poſſeſſed of al <hi>France,</hi> ſo that the Kings of <hi>Fraunce</hi> knewe not where to ſet a foote for
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:10495:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
theirs: yet notwithſtanding they were alwaies obeyed, none of all thoſe that were left theirs, refuſing to bee taxed, or to bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed at the King his pleaſure, ſo that this patience preuayled, and in the ende chaſed his enemies out of the realme. I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that if a Prince did vſe himſelfe towards his ſubiects like a Tyrant, alwaies euill intreating and miſuſing them, that if an enemie did aſſault him in his countrie, he might then bee in hazard to be ill followed and obeyed of his people: but in doing the contrarie, there is no doubt to be had in this matter. One thing there is for them that do aſſaile, &amp; which is a great poynt, that is, that Souldiers who find themſelues in a ſtrange coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie farre from any refuge to retyre vnto, ſeeing themſelues in that extremitie, do fight ſo much the more reſolute, making a vertue of neceſſitie: but this neceſſitie may not be compared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the need that thoſe haue to fight vertuouſly that are aſſailed, becauſe that they are in danger to abide many extremities more then the aſſailants, if the ſaid aſſailants ſhould ouerthrow them: for the loſſe of life, raunſome, or impriſonment, do pay the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning for them: whereas thoſe that are aſſailed, do loſe their goods, the honeſt reputation of their wiues and daughters, and their liues: and if ſo bee that they do eſcape killing, yet do they looke for a perpetuall ſeruitude, with an infinite number of other miſchiefs: ſo that the aduantage on both ſides is cléerely ſeen, and the aſſailant cannot haue one reaſon ſo ſtrong for him, but the aſſailed may haue a better. Wherefore I do make no doubt to reſt vpon this concluſion, that is, that euery Prince ought to haue a regarde, before hee enter into the countrie of another Prince his neighbour that is as mightie as himſelfe, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer maketh himſelfe to be well beloued and obeyed of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, as wée ſee the King is. And beſides the reaſons aforeſayd, he that is aſſayled may attend the comming of his enemies into his countrie with a great aduantage: for that he may famiſh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and take from them the vſe of all things appertayning vnto a Campe, without the daunger of hauing any lacke of victuall on his ſide. Moreouer, he may withſtand the enterpriſes of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and impeach them to be executed, if the aſſailed haue bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter notice of the countrie and paſſages, than the aſſailants haue.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:10495:84"/>
To bee briefe, he may make great ſtore of people in ſhort time: for there is no bodie but will be readie at a néed to enter into bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile to defend his owne, and of theſe there will be found an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to one of thoſe that are content to leaue their owne dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, to the intent to make warres againſt other men. But let vs ſuppoſe that a Prince that is aſſayled in his owne countrie is ouerthrowne, euery man knoweth well that he may recouer it againe in ſhort ſpace: becauſe that the vanquiſhed cannot bée ſo vtterly ouerthrowne, but that there will a great many ſaue themſelues, becauſe of the retreat they haue ſo nere them: more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, his ſuccour is not farre of to come vnto him. In ſomme, he that is aſſayled in his countrie can hazard little but part of his forces: but if the aſſailant bee ouerthrowne, he doth not only put his people in hazard, but alſo his ſtate, goods, and ſubiects; notwithſtanding that he is out of his countrie: for being taken, he ſhall bee conſtrayned to remayne priſoner all the daies of his life, or to accompliſh the wil of the vanquiſher, and God knowes what conditions of peace are vſed to bee giuen vnto thoſe that are in hands if they make peace, and what raunſomes they muſt pay for their deliuerie before that they bee let goe. Beſides all this daunger, into what inconuenience would the aſſailant his countrie fall into if he were ſlaine? Would it be poſſible that a battaile might be loſt vpon another man his ground, without the ſlaughter of all the beſt Captaines and Souldiers? Or that his countrie being aduertiſed of his death, &amp; of the ouerthrow of his men, would not looſe all their hope to defend themſelues, if they ſhould be aſſayled vpon the heate of this trouble? All theſe things conſidered, I may conclude that he is in greater hazard that doth aſſayle his neighbour, then he that doth ſtay for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him: as the comming of the aboue ſayd Emperour doth giue me occaſion to ſpeake, which is the fitteſt example that I may alleadge for this matter. And although that the ſayd Emperour did not taſte of the inconueniences that might haue inſued of ſuch an enterpriſe; yet he was vpon the way to haue prooued them all, if hée had ſtayed any thing longer in the king his countrie. And this is ſo well knowne, that there is no man that can ſpeake againſt it, how little iudgement ſoeuer he haue.</p>

                        <pb n="143" facs="tcp:10495:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>Concerning this matter, I muſt here make aunſwere vnto ſome that miſliked at that time (as it was told me) that the ſayd Lord Conſtable went not forwards towards the mountaynes to ſtoppe the paſſage of the Emperour: ſaying, that becauſe of the difficultie of the paſſage, fiue hundred men had béen ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to haue ſtopped ten thouſand, and that therefore the one halfe of our people had been ſtrong enough to haue repulſed our enemies: or if that the aforeſayd Lord Conſtable had been forced, he might haue retyred time enough vnto <hi>Auignon</hi> (if ſo bee that he would haue encamped there as he did) and that in ſo doing <hi>Prouince</hi> had not béen deſtroyed. But thoſe that vſed theſe words did not looke néere enough into the daungers that we might haue fallen into, if that their opinion had had place: for firſt of all it had not been wiſely done to haue ſtayed to defend a paſſage agaynſt ſuch a power, as that was that came againſt vs: nor likewiſe for him to haue incloſed himſelfe in a naughtie barren countrie, out of which he could not haue retyred, and haue had ſafe going and comming at all times: except the place had been ſo large, &amp; beſides ſo fit for the attendants, that they might haue placed a great Camp eaſely, and there haue raunged their battailes in order to fight. If it had been ſo, their counſaile had been good, ſpecially for if that the enemies would haue aſſayled them, they muſt haue done it in diſorder, our men attending in their fort in good order to receiue them: but it is ſo (as it hath béen tolde me) that there is no place in all that paſſage, wherein it was poſſible for vs to finde that commoditie, or to impeach the ſayd aſſaylants from comming diuers waies vppon the backes of the attendants. Wherefore conſidering of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine comming and of the great force of the ſayd aſſaylants, who were maiſters of the Sea, and ſo mightie vpon land, as euery man knoweth, that it had been in their powers to haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed and aſſayled on euery ſide all thoſe that ſhould haue ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed their faces in thoſe ſtraights: it was better done of the ſayd Lord to keepe himſelfe farre from them, then to haue been there and to haue lodged himſelfe in this daunger. Suppoſe that he might haue made a good retreat at all times; yet is it ſo that if he had been driuen away by his enemies, his reputation had
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:10495:85"/>
béen leſſe worthie by a great deale. And when as a Generall doth make his accompt to keepe a place or paſſage, and that his Souldiers do truſt thereunto: if it happen afterwards that his enemies do enforce him to forſake it, it is ſure that ſuch a feare will come vpon them al at once, that it will be hard in long time after to put them in heart agayne, ſpecially if there haue been ſome ſmall number beaten: for that will make others that ſhall but heare of it to be as much a feard, as if they had carried part of the blowes themſelues.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Spanyards</hi> that kept the paſſage at <hi>Suze,</hi> albeit that they were a great number, yet the Lord Conſtable ouerthrew them eaſie enough: ſo that thereby may bée knowne that it is not ſo ſure a match to ſtay and keepe theſe ſtraights, ſpecially the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants not hauing many aduantages on their ſides, and an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie of great force in his teeth, which doth aſſaile him fiercely as the ſayd Lord and his did. The ſayd <hi>Spanyards</hi> might well haue perceiued the errour which they did commit in repoſing all their truſt in the keeping of the ſayd paſſage: for being driuen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by force, they were ſo ſcared that hardly they durſt looke behind them to ſee who peruſed them: and not only thoſe that had been beaten were ſo aſtonied, but alſo they were ſo afeard that beſieged <hi>Pignerol,</hi> that they ranne away ſecretly by night, and all thoſe that were of the league were afeard, vntill ſuch time as we ceaſed to purſue them. Moreouer, the Lord Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable did wiſely to leaue the ſtraight, and to keepe himſelfe at large: for by that meane he might haue made reſiſtance vnto the ſayd enemies, if that they had come any other way then that they did: which he could not haue done, if he had buſied himſelfe to keepe one paſſage expreſſely, for that it is not ſayd that there are no more paſſages through the mountaines to enter into <hi>Fraunce</hi> then that which they came: nor likewiſe that they ſhould haue lacked guides to haue ſhewed them ſome entrance: ſo that although that the ſayd Lord had kept them, yet it had not been poſſible for him to haue kept all the other: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to haue kept himſelfe from being incloſed, or that his enemie ſhould not haue béen farre entred into the countrie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he could haue gotten vnto his refuge.</p>

I ſay that the retreat of the ſayd <hi>Switzers,</hi> who made their accoumpt that the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> ſhould not paſſe, was cauſe that many townes in <hi>Italy</hi> turned vnto vs inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent: for hauing repoſed all their truſt in the <hi>Switzers</hi> promiſe, and finding immediatlye after that our armie was within the countrie, and had paſſed contrarye vnto the opinion of all men, the <hi>Lombards</hi> were ſo diſcouraged, and in that extremitie that they knewe not vnto what ſainct to bequeath themſelues, or to take any other counſell, but to render themſelues at the hearing of it: as (it may bee thought) the townes in the plaine coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>Daulphine</hi> and <hi>Prouince</hi> would haue done, if our armie had beene placed to keepe the paſſages, and that the Emperour ſhould haue driuen them away. To bee ſhort, thoſe that thought it to bee ſtrange that our Campe was lodged ſo far from the mountaines, doe ſhew that they haue not greatly vſed this occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation. For a Generall ought neuer to ſtay in ſuch like places, except he haue meanes (as I haue before ſaid) to plant all his forces, &amp; that there be no other place to paſſe farre from that hee dooth kéepe: &amp; yet it is neceſſarie that the place where the Campe ſhould ſtay, ſhould haue all theſe commodities that are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for it, as wood, water, forrage, &amp; the paſſages for victualers to come to the Campe free and open: and moreouer that the ſcituatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould be wholly as neceſſary as might be. A Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Generall lying neare vnto his enemies Campe, may ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bee importuned by his Souldiers to giue battaile: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that hee knoweth by the number of his people, or
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:10495:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by the ſcituation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place, or by ſome other reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that it ſhould be to his great diſaduantage to fight. It may likewiſe come to paſſe, that when either neceſſitie or occaſion giuen do conſtraine him to fight, that he ſhall then find his Souldiers diſcomforted, and not diſpoſed to doe well: therefore it is neceſſarie to knowe howe to bridle their deſire in the one caſe, and howe to animate them in the other. As concerning the firſt caſe, if perſwaſions would not ſuffice, there were no better remedye then to ſuffer ſome ſmall companie to léeſe themſelues at their owne deſires, to the intent that the reſt might giue him the more credit, which happened vnto <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> vnlooked for: for when as his hoaſt was deſirous to fight againſt <hi>Anniball; Minutius</hi> the Captaine Generall of the <hi>Romanes</hi> Horſemen, being himſelfe as forward in the matter as the reſt, which although it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary vnto the opinion of the ſayd <hi>Fabius</hi> being <hi>Dictator,</hi> yet proceeded ſo farr in this variance, that they deuided the armie: &amp; the armie being deuided, <hi>Minutius</hi> preſenting battaile vnto his enemies, who accepted it, had bin vtterlye ouerthrowne, had not the <hi>Dictator</hi> helped to ſuccour him. Which the ſaid <hi>Minutius</hi> and his Souldiers ſéeing, gouerned themſelues euer after by the counſell of <hi>Fabius,</hi> as the moſt ſureſt, without enterpriſing at any time after any thing of their owne heads. <hi>Sertorius,</hi> when he could not bridle the bouldnes of his men, was content to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer part of them to be well beaten: yet leaſt that they ſhould be vtterly ouerthrowne, he ſuccoured them at their néed, after which correction he was euer after better obeyed. Concerning the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimating of Souldiers vnto the Combate, it is not amiſſe to make them to haue their enemies in contempt, and to account but little of them, by giuing them to vnderſtand that their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſpeake reprochfull words of them, or to make ſhew to haue intelligence with ſome of the chiefeſt of their armie, and that a great part of them are corrupted, and alſo to lodge the Campe in ſome place where the Souldiers may fee their enemies, and ſkirmiſh with them: becauſe that thoſe things which men doe dayly ſee, they doe acquaint themſelues withall by little &amp; little: but we muſt handle theſe ſkirmiſhes ſo wiſely, that our Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers may alwaies haue the better hand of their enemies: for if
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:10495:86"/>
they ſhould haue the repulſe at the firſt, it is a thing moſt certaine that their feare &amp; want of courage would bee much more increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: and ſo it might happen quite contrarye vnto the Generall his meaning in approching ſo neare, and ſkirmiſhing with his enemies, to wit, for the imbouldening of them, and not for the diſmaying of them: wherefore a Generall muſt employ his ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, that nothing may take away his Souldiers harts from doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well, what accident ſoeuer might happen. And nothing may more diſcourage them then to bee beaten at the firſt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the remedie that I can ſee in this matter, is ſo to procéed againſt his enemies, that his may haue the better hand of them at their firſt arriuall, if it be poſſible. And to doe this, he ought not to ſkirmiſh at all with his enemies, but to keepe his men within his fort, vntill that hee ſee an aduantage, and ſéeing the aduantage manifeſtly, that then they might iſſue out of the forte vpon their enemies, &amp; vanquiſh them. A Lieutenant Generall may likewiſe make ſhew that hee is angrie with his people, and may make vnto them ſome oration of purpoſe, wherein he may reprooue them for the little valor that is in them: and to make them aſhamed, he might ſay that hee would fight with his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies although he ſhould bee left all alone, or if hee had but ſuch and ſuch to follow him: and this may bee an occaſion that the one to be accoumpted of no leſſe eſtimation then the other, will preſent themſelues: and the other to maintaine their reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will ſhew themſelues the readier to come vnto the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Caeſar</hi> helped himſelfe by this meanes in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> his ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers being afraid of the <hi>Almaignes,</hi> to make them to fight reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, and bee the better ſerued of them in the Battaile. Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ought neuer to bee ſuffered to ſend anye of theyr booties, or of their owne goods home vnto theyr houſes, or out of the Campe, vntill ſuch time as the warre bee ended: to the intent that they might knowe, that although in running awaye they might ſaue theyr liues, yet they could not ſaue theyr goods: the loue whereof will bee an occaſion to make them to fight as reſolutelye, as the daunger of the looſing of theyr liues. And as touching the perſwading and diſwading of a ſmall
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:10495:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>
number to doe any thing, is a thing eaſie ynough to be done: for that if they will not obey the Lieutenant Generall his words, he may vſe his authority and force: but the greateſt difficultie is, when as it ſhall be expedient to remooue a multitude from an euill opinion, which might be contrary vnto their common wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, or vnto his will: in which caſe for that he may but vſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, he muſt doe it publikely in the hearing of all his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, becauſe the matter dooth touch them all: &amp; for this cauſe good Captaines ought to be good Orators: for that not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how to exhort a whole armie, it will be hard to do any thing ought worthe. But at this day we make no great accompt of it, and yet it is a thing ſo neceſſarie, that to doe well without it is almoſt a thing impoſſible: I meane, for to doe anye act of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. Who ſo would read the life of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, &amp; of many other Princes and Chiefes that haue bin héeretofore, he ſhould finde that it hath oft times beene néedfull for them to ſpeake publikely vnto their armies, and to vſe exhortations vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, when as they would haue any great matter doone: for many times there maye accidents happen in an armye, by meanes whereof it might be ouerthrowne if the Generall could not play the Orator, or if hee ſhould not ſpeake vnto them pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, as the auncient Chiefes were accuſtomed to doe, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, that ſpeach hath manye and ſundrye effects in it ſelfe: for it taketh away feare, it enflameth the hearts of Souldiers; it maketh them the more firme and reſolute for the Combate; it diſcouereth deceits; it promiſeth recompence; it ſheweth dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and the meane to auoide them; it reprooueth, entreateth, exhorteth, filleth full of hope, praiſeth and blameth: and in ſum; a Lieutenant Generall may by his ſpeach doe all thoſe things, wherwith mens paſſions are either mortified or kindled. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the King were determined to maintayne his firſt Legio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, or to leauie other, after the maner ſpoken of in the firſte booke, or a better, he ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund his Colonels to accuſtome the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to ſpeake publikely to their ſouldiers, that they might bee accuſtomed to heare them to ſpeake, to the intent that they ſhould not find it ſtrange to come together vnto the declaration that their Lieutenant Generall would make them, whenſoeuer
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:10495:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they ſhould be called therevnto by his Trumpet. Heeretofore the reuerence that men had vnto religion, was much worthe to kéepe Souldiers in feare and obedience, and likewiſe the othe whith they made when they were led into the field: for then thoſe that committed any offence, or thoſe that did contrary vnto their othes and promiſes, were not ſo greatly threatned to incur cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall paines, which equitie and lawe ordeined: as they were threatned that they ſhould fall into the indignation of the gods whom they worſhipped, which being mingled with other ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions, was oftentimes an occaſion that the Chiefes who were at that time, came more eaſily vnto the end of their enterpriſes: and at this day it would doe no leſſe, if ſo be that God were fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red better then hee is, and that wee made a greater account of Chriſtian religion then we doe. <hi>Sertorius</hi> did make his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to beléeue that a tame Deare which he had, did aduertiſe him of all things touching the pleaſure of the gods, which was cauſe that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> gaue too great credit vnto his words: ſpecially for that they beléeued that he knew their newes ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before that they did themſelues, and as for thoſe things that were doone farre from the Campe, and thoſe things that hee tooke in hande with an aſſurance to bring to paſſe, hee made ſhew that he vnderſtood them by the ſayd beaſt. <hi>Silla</hi> ſaid that he had intelligence by an Image that he had out of the Temple of <hi>Apollo</hi> in <hi>Delphos,</hi> which hee carried alwayes in his boſome when he entered into Battaile. In the time of King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeauenth, in the warres which he had with the <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> was <hi>Iahane</hi> the maiden of <hi>Fraunce</hi> eſteemed to bee a diuine perſon, and euery one affirmed that ſhe was ſent from God: but ſome wil ſay it was the King that inuented this policie, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> giuing them to vnderſtand that God had a care of the realme, and therewithall the King tooke great paines that the ſayde <hi>Iahane</hi> might bee found veritable in her words, and that the moſt part of her enterpriſes might come to good effect, for the execution whereof ſhee armed hir ſelfe, and was alwaies amongſt the knights in the combate. The <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> were ſo encouraged through the truſt that they had therin that from thenceforth the <hi>Engliſhmens</hi> force did diminiſh, and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:10495:88"/>
theirs did augment. Moreouer there may bee meanes found to make Souldiers to make but little accompt of their enemies, which to doe <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> King of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> ſhewed vnto his Souldiers certaine <hi>Perſians</hi> naked, to the intent that they ſéeing the bodies of the ſaide <hi>Perſians</hi> white and delicate, ſhould haue no occaſion to feare them, but to eſtéeme of them as ſofte and effeminate people. Diuers good Captaines haue hetherto made their Souldiers to fight through verye force, taking from them all the hope that they might haue to ſaue themſelues if they ſhould breake, or ſéeke to eſcape otherwiſe then by the victory. <hi>Agathocles</hi> helped himſelfe by this means in <hi>Affrike,</hi> and it is alſo the moſt ſureſt to make Souldiers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute: which reſolution will bee augmented through the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that they haue to get the victorie, &amp; alſo through the loue that they doe beare vnto their Captaine Generall, &amp; vnto their Prince: which confidence procéedeth of that they are better ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, or better ranged, then their enemies, and of their getting of ſome battaile of freſh memorie, and likewiſe of the good opinion that they haue of their captaine Generall. As for the loue which they do beare vnto their naturall Prince &amp; country, it is nature that is cauſe of it, as vertue is cauſe of the affection that Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers doe beare vnto their Captaine Generall which may doe much more in this matter, then giftes or any other thing: and although that a man may vſe other meanes to win the hearts of men of war: yet the reputation that a Generall Chiefe hath to be a valiant &amp; good man, paſſeth all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other that may be thought vpon. Concerning the conſtraining of an armie to fight againſt their wils, may be in diuers manners: notwithſtanding that is the greateſt which conſtraineth an armie to vanquiſh or to die in the field, which is a fit remedie for thoſe, who fight not for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue that they do beare vnto the Prince that dooth pay them: nor for the confidence that they haue in their Generall. Of which ſorte are all the mercinaries properly, who would neuer giue one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thruſt with a Pike, if they ſhould not be forced therevnto, or that it were not too great a ſhame for them not to do it, as for any other cauſe they will neuer put themſelues in danger: wherfore it is moſt certaine, that the ſeruice of thoſe who fight for the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:10495:88"/>
loue of their naturall Lorde, and their countrie is much better and more aſſured: for beſides this bonde of amitie, they ſhall be renowmed to bee valiant men, which is of no leſſe value with them, then force and conſtraint is with the other.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue héertofore ſpoken of the maner that an hoaſt ought to keepe in giuing of a battaile, and after what maner it ought to be gouerned, hauing their enemies harde by them: and alſo the manner how to vanquiſh them. Moreouer I haue ſpoken of many circumſtances appertinent to this buſines, wholly accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto the accidents that might happen before the giuing of a battaile, in fighting, after the vanquiſhing of an enemie, or the receiuing of an ouerthrow: &amp; as I thinke I haue ſaid ſo much therein, that it were now time to change purpoſe, and to ſhewe how foure ſuch Legions as theſe which I haue ordained, ought to be ranged in traueling (although no enemies be ſeene) when as a Leiutena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Generall that hath foure ſuch legions in charge, is continually in doubt to be aſſaulted: which may happen when as he marcheth through his enemies country, or through a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie ſuſpect. Firſt of all we muſt vnderſtand that the <hi>Romanes</hi> armie being in this caſe, did alwaies ſend out certaine troopes of Horſemen far before their battailes, for to diſcouer the waies; and after them marched the right pointe of their Battailon in order ready to ſight, &amp; at the taile of it marched all the baggage of the ſame point. After that marched another Legion and their baggage behinde them, and afterward the third Legion &amp; their baggage, &amp; laſt of all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> left point &amp; their baggage at their tailes, behind which baggage marched all the horſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; this maner did the ſaid <hi>Romans</hi> ordinarily vſe in going through the country: &amp; if the hoaſt were aſſayled either before or behinde, they cauſed
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:10495:89"/>
theyr baggage and carriage to be retired all at once either vpon the left ſide or vpon the right ſide, as came beſt to hande, and when the Souldiers and place were free of all incumbrances, the Battailes turned their faces towardes that ſide that their enemies came to aſſault them on. And if ſo bee that they were aſſayled vpon one of the flankes, they put their baggage one the other ſide, and made head vnto their enemyes. Me thinkes that this manner of marching through an enemie his countrie, ſhould be the beſt that might be imitated in this caſe: we might likewiſe ſend out before on euery ſide a good number of Hargo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letiers and Harquebuſiers a Horſebacke to diſcouer the wayes round about our hoaſt, &amp; ſend part of our light Horſſemen to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſaid Hargoletiers and Harquebuſiers ſomwhat néere to ſuccour them, if they ſhould haue anye encounter; the battailes (as is aforeſaid) marching in good order with their rankes at large, ſo that the way were broad ynough, or at the leaſt that in euery ranke ſhould be ten me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. As for to marche at length being in an enemies country, is an euill counſell. The Legions ought euery one to march by themſelues, with their cariages at their backes, after the maner of the <hi>Romanes.</hi> And for that there are two ſorts of baggage, to wit, one that perteineth vnto the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers particularly, and the cariages which doe appertaine vnto the common vſe, as the prouiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of victuals, armes, &amp; Ordnance; it would not bee amiſſe to deuide the ſayd carriage into foure parts, and to giue vnto each legion beſides their particular bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, the one fourth part of the publke cariages. Moreouer it would be well done to deuide the Ordnaunce into fower partes if it were but to auoyde the enuie that would bee amongſt men of warre, if the one part of the armie ſhould haue it in charge and the other not, or if the one ſhould haue more then the other. And likewiſe the vnarmed people ought to be deuided equally, ſuch as Pyoners, Carters, Victualers, men of occupation, and other poore people that do follow a Campe to get their liuing: to the intent that euery number of armed men might haue iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their charge, that the one ſhould not be more aduantaged and charged then the other. But when as it dooth happen that an hoaſte doth trauaile through a countrey that is not onely ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:10495:89"/>
but alſo is ſuch an enemie as the ſayde Hoaſte dooth looke euerye hower to bee aſſayled, then the forme of martching before ſpoken of may be altred, and the hoaſt ranged in another order, which order ſhould bee ſo good, that neither the people of the Countrey, or an enemie his armie might at any time finde the Lieuetenaunt Generall, nor his battailes in diſorder, in any one poinct: nor likewiſe giue him any repulſe, or to doe any do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage vnto his men. To auoide the daunger of theſe ſuddaine aſſaults which are made by ſtealth, the auncient Chiefes, were accuſtomed to martch with their hoaſtes ſquare, not that they were altogeather ſquare: but they were raunged with foure fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and by that meanes they martched through their enemie his Countrey, beeing ready to defend themſelues, whenſoeuer that they ſhould bee aſſaulted, and vſed no other forme, except they were conſtrained to fight with their Battailes raunged, or that they were charged with too great a force of enemies. This manner of marching will I vſe in this place, and will ſhew how to order fower Legions after this manner, by immitating of whoſe example a greater armie may bee conducted, to martch through out all Countries, without daunger af enemies, and to make head one what part ſoeuer that it ſhould be aſſayled. The Battailes muſt bee raunged in ſuche ſort, that the firſt Legion muſt be at the right corner of the ſaid ſquare, and the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> of this Legion, ſhould occupie their accuſtomed place towardes the eaſt: (for it ſhalbe ſuppoſed, that they do martch toward the eaſt) and afterward the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Triaries</hi> muſt place them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues towardes the South: ſo that they and the ſaid <hi>Haſtaries</hi> ſhall make a right angle which is one fourth part of a quadrant.</p>
                     <p>The ſeconde Legion ſhalbe placed vpon the left corner and the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> of the ſaide Legion, ſhalbe raunged on the eaſt part, as the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> of the firſt Legion: ſo that the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> of theſe two legions, ſhall make the front of the ſaid ſquare vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the eaſt ſide, leauing a ſpace of ten paces diſtaunt betwixt the ſaide two legions. The <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Triaries</hi> of the ſecond legion muſt bee raunged on the north ſide, who beeing ioyned vnto their <hi>Haſtaries,</hi> ſhall make another angle, and by that meanes, theſe two legions are the one halfe of the quadrant.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:10495:90"/>
and to finiſhe it, the third Legion muſt bee raunged behinde the firſt, in ſuche ſort, that the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> of that legion ſhall make the one halfe of the angle towardes the Weſt, to ſhew their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that way if it ſhould be needfull: and their <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries,</hi> ſhall make the other halfe of the corner, and ſhal haue their faces towardes the South, if it ſhould be needfull, and ſhal ioyn vnto the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Triaries</hi> of the firſt Legion: reſeruing the ſpace that ought to be left betwixt them, which ſhalbe ten paces as is aforeſaide: and theſe ſpaces ſhall likewiſe be obſerued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the people, and the other Legions, to the intent that they do not touch one another: and there muſt bee a regard had, that thoſe ſpaces may be kept. The fourth Legion ſhalbe raunged behind the ſecond, placing the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> on the weſt ſide, and the <hi>Princes,</hi> and <hi>Triaries</hi> on the north: ſo that the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> of the firſt and ſecond Legions, ſhal make the front, and the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> of the third and fourth ſhall make the taile. The <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Triaries</hi> of the firſt &amp; third Legions, ſhall make the right ſide, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Triaries</hi> of the ſecond and fourth, ſhall make the left ſide: &amp; theſe two ſaid ſides, when neede requireth, ſhal turne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faces towards their two Regions, to wit, thoſe vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right ſide towards the South, &amp; thoſe on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> left ſide towards y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> North.</p>
                     <p>All which fower Legions ſhall make one quadrant, not that it ſhalbe perfectly ſquare, foraſmuch as it ſhalbe a little more in length then in breadth, for from the front vnto the taile, there ſhalbe a more ſpace left, then from the one ſide vnto the other, which ſquare or quadrant ſhalbe ordred in ſuch ſort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſpaces which I haue ſaid, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhalbe left betwixt the bandes in the front, when they are in their firſt order, ſhould likewiſe be left now: &amp; the diſtance from the one rank to the other, ſhold be alwais kept according vnto the forme of the <hi>Haſtaries,</hi> and as I haue ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. By this meanes, the place that this ſquare btttaile wil oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie, may haue in breadth 470. paces, and 590. in length.</p>
                     <p>Within the ſaide battail, there ſhalbe an emptie ſpace, which ſhalbe in length, 470. paces, and in breadth 340. and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſame place, ſhall the fower Colonels be placed, to witte the Colonell of the firſt Legion, in the right corner of the front, and the Colonell of the ſecond Legion, within the corner of the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:10495:90"/>
ſeconde Legion: and the others likewiſe within the corner of their Legions with their garde, to the intent, that euerie man might be neere, and haue an eie to ouer looke his people. The Lieuetenant Generall may be within this emptie place, right againſt the ſpace which is betwixt the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> of the two Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions in the front, accompanied with his garde, and with thoſe that doe follow his Cornet. The Pikes of the Flanks may be raunged within the ſaid emptie place ioyning vnto their bands, and the Harquebuſiers of the flankes by them, who ſhall leaue the ſpaces betwixt the bandes, as the bandes them ſelues doo. As for the Captaines, and other members and officers, they ſhalbee in their places appointed them before, and the forlorne hope ſhalbe without vppon the fower ſides of the Battaile, in their order, or they may bee with in: and likewiſe the baggage and carriage ſhall be within the emptie place, which the fower Legions doe make. And the Ordnaunce maye martch alongeſt the Flankes, or at the heade and taile. The Péeces vppon the Flankes, may martch one after another: but thoſe in the front and at the taile ſhall martch one by another, for otherwiſe, they could not helpe them ſelues with it, when it ſhalbe needfull, nor eaſily to defend it, if it ſhould be aſſaulted.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Horſemen, the Harquebuſiers, and the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goletiers, muſt bee raunged on euerie ſide, a good way off, that the light horſmen might be betwixt them and the men of arms, and that the men of armes might be at the leaſt, fifty paces from the battaile, raunged vpon the fower ancomminges, by ſimple <hi>Decuries,</hi> or double or more, to witte, one of the companies of the firſt Legion ſhalbe at the front, and the other vpon the right Flanke, the one of the companies of the ſecond legion, ſhould be likewiſe at the front of the battaile before the ſaide legion, &amp; the other vpon the left Flank: &amp; the companies of the other two le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions ſhould be likewiſe behinde, and vpon the Flankes eache of them by the legion they belong vnto. One thing a Lieuete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Generall muſt note in this place, for a generall rule, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, that as often as he ſhal range his army for to fight, he take heed, not to range his horſmen before his battails, except he do place them ſo far of, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> beeing repulſed, they may haue ſpace inough to retire beſide y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> footmen: for otherwiſe hee might ouerrune them:
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:10495:91"/>
Or els he muſt leaue many ſpaces in the front of the ſaid foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to the intent that the horſmen might return with in them, without breaking or diſordering their rankes. And of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſement, hee ought to make no ſmall account. For manye Chiefes which hertofore haue not regarded it, haue found them ſelues deceiued, and their people haue bene broken, and ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led one among another, when as their horſemen haue been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed by their enemies.</p>
                     <p>Our fower Legions beeing ordered in that fourme that I haue ſpoken off, may put them ſelues forward to martch vppon the way, when as it ſhall pleaſe them, and may keepe the ſaid or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der going a good pace. I do not ſay that in traueiling, not being troubled by an enemie, that they ſhould alwaies keep the ranks of their <hi>Haſtaries</hi> ſo néer together nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſouldiers of the, <hi>Princes</hi> &amp; <hi>Triaries,</hi> likewiſe as I haue ſpoken before: for they could not carry their Pikes vpon their ſhoulders, but ſhold be conſtrained to beare them right vp an end, for it would be impoſſible to carry them otherwiſe, becauſe of the little ſpace betwixt the rankes. But my meaning is, that when as they would reſiſt the aſſault of their enemies, that then they ſhould ioyne togeather in ſuche order as is ſpoken of. And if ſo bee, that their enemies did but ſkirmiſh with them, to trouble them vpon the way, &amp; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding were alwaies ready to aſſault them, and that the ſayd fower Legions, would winne ground and not fight: in ſuche a caſe, the Souldiers muſt carrie their Pikes right vp, although it be more painefull: for the neceſſitie, which they ſhould haue to martch cloſe togeather, would eaſe their paines. But if that they ſhould not bee enforced, there would bee no daunger, if the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> rankes ſhould follow one another at more ſcope, and that the <hi>princes</hi> and <hi>Triaries</hi> ſhoulde occupie more grownd in length to c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>tch their Pikes, and to march at more eaſe: for the horſemen and the forlorne hope which doe enuirone this ſquare battaile, would be ſufficient inough to ſtay the aſſaulters, vntill ſuch time as the battaile were brought neere together into their order, for their wold be no more to doo, but ſtay the firſt ranks, &amp; to cauſe the others to come forward neerer them. Moreouer, it is not to be doubted, that people who aſſault without keeping
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:10495:91"/>
order and ranke, ſhould euer haue the courage and good will to approche them that are well ordered and ranked within the length of a Pike, nor the Harquebuſiers within the ſhotte of a Harquebuſſe, except they had ſome aduantage of ground, as if it were that theſe Legions kept the lower ground and their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies the higher, or that there were ſome great riuer betwixte them: my meaning is that this order is onely for a plaine coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, for in troubleſome paſſages it is not good, but when as they ſhould paſſe neare or betwixte mountaines, the plaine being large enough to receaue them in this order: the remedy muſt be to get the higheſt ground, and driue away their enemies. For otherwiſe although that the Legions ſhould keepe the forme of a ſquare Battaile, or of Battailons ranged by themſelues, I would neuer be of opinion that they ſhould put themſelues into ſtraight paſſages, except that they were maiſters of the higher ground. The Lord of <hi>Montpezat</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he returned into <hi>Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce</hi> with the bands that he had vnder him at <hi>Foſſar,</hi> being conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to take his way through the valley of <hi>Pratgella,</hi> the entrey into which is moſt difficill, ſeeing that the mountaines were held by the people of the countrey, and certaine men of warre which were ioyned with them, and that he was not entred farre within the ſayde mountaines, without the loſſe of a certaine number of his people, which were ſlaine and maimed by theyr enemies, who kept themſelues in the higher ground, being there placed to haue doone him miſchiefe enough, if it had not béene ſpéedily looked into: the ſayd Lorde ſent immediatly part of his people vnder the charge of <hi>Monſieur Dambres,</hi> to get the higher ground, to driue away his enemies, which thing thoſe that were ſent did ſo well execute, marching alwayes vpon the higher ground on the winges of his Battailes; that there was not a <hi>Frenchman</hi> hurt afterwardes, whereas before they were a marke for their enemies to ſhoote at: it is all the remedye that may bee vſed in ſuche lyke paſſages. But if it were in a plaine, Horſſemen with the helpe of Harquebuſiers, may ſtaye an enemie farre off, without hindering of the Battailes in loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of theyr time, for that Horſemen may maintaine a ſkirmiſh with an enemy, winning ground alwaies, not running far from
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:10495:92"/>
the battaile, nor forgetting themſelues otherwiſe. True it is, that in marching in this order ſquare, it were neceſſary that the Country ſhould be euen &amp; open, that the battail might alwaies continew as it was ordred: and therfore it ſhould be neceſſary to haue a great number of Pioners, to make the way plain &amp; open, wheras it ſhould paſſe, &amp; the ſaid Pioners might be defended by the Hargoletiers, and other diſcouerers, if their enemies were not able to repulſe them: but if ſo be that their enemies were of force ſufficient to repulſe the ſaide diſcouerers: the other horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men following at their backs, would relieue them, or if it came to the worſt, the Pioners might retyre within the battailes, and the horſemen vnto the flanks, if they could not ſtay their enemies otherwiſe: for which enemies there néede no iot of this order of martching be changed, except that they were ſo great a number that they might aſſail theſe Legions ranked in battaile: but this aſſault cannot be done ſo ſuddainely, but that the Generall ſhal haue time inough to retire the Pyoners, &amp; to range his people in order to giue battaille: for as he in marching on his way, doth go but an ordinary pace, ſo an enemy in comming towards him doth martch but an ordinary pace: ſo that the one aſwell as the other, doe goe ſo leaſurelie, that they ſhall alwaies haue leaſure inough to prouide on both ſides. Beſides the diſcouerers who are abroad, will aduertiſe the ſaid Generall time inough: &amp; then hee may bring the Legions into the ſame order that is taught in the firſt booke: and if he be aſſaulted vpon the front, he may turn the mouth of the Cannon, towardes his enemies, and put the horſemen vpon the wings, and cauſe the third Legion to range themſelues in their firſt order and accuſtomed place, and the fourth likewiſe: and the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Triaries</hi> of eache Legion to take their places.</p>
                     <p>In the meane while, the ordnance may play their partes, and the forlorne hope with the Harquebuſiers a horſebacke, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goletiers many likewiſe doe theirs. The Baggage muſt bee retyred behind the Legion with the Pyoners, and the vnarmed men, who may make themſelues ſtrong with wagons, coffers, packes, and other carriages, with al which, they may entrenche themſelues, if ſo be that they had no ſtrong place neere to retyre
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:10495:92"/>
vnto, or time to fortifie. Yet if leaſure would ſerue, it would be better to ſtay and to make ſome place ſtrong before the battail, then to hazarde a battaile before a Campe were made to retyre vnto if néed were. And if ſo bee that the ſaid enemie would aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault theſe Legions behinde, the Lieuetenant Generall muſt make the head of the Battailons that way, or towardes any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part that he looketh to be aſſaulted vpon. And if ſo be that the ſaid enemie ſhould aſſault him vppon two ſides, and that hee were of force inough to doe it; this Generall ought to take Souldiers from the other two ſides that are not aſſaulted, to ſtrengthen thoſe that are aſſaulted, or els hee muſt vſe another manner of order, to witte, to raunge the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Triaries</hi> all in one front, or to do otherwiſe, that is in euerie Legion to retyre one band of <hi>Haſtaries,</hi> and to place it with another band of <hi>Princes,</hi> and that thoſe two bands ſhould raunge themſelues in 10. rankes at the backes of the ſaid <hi>Haſtaries:</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two bandes of <hi>Princes,</hi> ſhould retyre backwards to be ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the <hi>Triaries:</hi> ſo that at the front their ſhould be fower bandes, and at the taile as many, and the two bands in the midſt ſhoulde ſtretche out their rankes, and ſhoulde occupie aſmuche ground in breadth as the other fower, and this muſt bee doone throughout al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Legions: and ſo their would be two fronts wel furniſhed, and the Flankes alſo would bee ſufficient inough of them ſelues, beſides the Pikes of the Flankes for to helpe them. And when as the front were broken they might retire vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the two bands in the midſt to make an enemy to fight againe with them.</p>
                     <p>I haue ſpoken before of theſe two formes, and therefore to returne to my matter: I ſaye that if the Generall of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Armie ſhoulde aſſayle theſe our aforeſayde fower Legy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vppon two or three partes: that eyther hee or wee were not bee thought wiſe. For if a Generall Chiefe bee wiſe, hee will neuer put hym ſelfe into a place where an enemye maye aſſayle hym with a great power vppon ſo many ſides, or parts.</p>
                     <p>For ſo it is, that hee that will hurt another man, and bee ſure to take no hurt hym ſelfe, but deale vppon the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:10495:93"/>
aduantage, muſt néeds haue vpon euery ſide, that hee would aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile his enemy, aſmuch people, or very neer aſmuch, as his ſaid enemie hath in all his: if ſo be then that our Generall ſhould he ſo euill aduiſed, as to enter into a Prince his Countrie, his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, who had three or fower times as many Souldiers as him ſelfe, and ſhould take anye hurt: there were no reaſon, but that he ſhould blame his owne lacke of vnderſtanding, &amp; not put the fault in his ill lucke. But let vs put caſe, that the General of our enemies hoaſt, hath but a fewe Souldiers more then wee haue: and not withſtanding, thinking to put vs into diſorder, he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vs in diuers places: you may ſay then, that the folly is his, and the aduantage is ours: As for to aſſayle our fower legions, in which of the fourmes aboueſaid ſoeuer they ſhould bee raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, hee ſhalbe forced to make his battailes ſo thinne and ſmall, that our armie might eaſilie reſiſt the one, and beat the other, and by that meanes get the victorie.</p>
                     <p>Our Generall might alſo (if he thought it good) raunge his Legions two and two together, or euery one a part, in manner of a ſquare, &amp; leaue a place emptie in the midſt, which he might doo after this maner: that is, that one Legion ſhould make the front with his <hi>Haſtaries,</hi> &amp; the left Flank with his <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Triaries,</hi> and that the other legion ſhould make the tail with his <hi>Haſtaries,</hi> and the right Flanke with his <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Triaries,</hi> and ſo theſe two Legions ſhould occupy 230. paces in breadth, and 350. in length: and the ſquare that ſhould be left empty in the midſt, ſhould haue 110. paces in breadth, and 230 in length. Touching the raunging of theſe legions by themſelues, three bandes of <hi>Haſtaries</hi> might make the fronte, and the other two ſhould be placed, one band vpon the one Flanke, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bande vppon the other Flanke. Likewiſe two bandes of the <hi>Princes,</hi> might raunge themſelues vpon the Flanks behind the other two bandes of the ſaid <hi>Haſtaries</hi> in a right line, &amp; the third band ſhould make the taile with the <hi>Triaries:</hi> for by that means the ſpace that one legion ſo ordred would occupie, might bee 136. paces in breadth, and 219. in length: the ſpace which is left empty in the midſt, ſhould haue by this reckoning 16. pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in breadth, and 99. in length.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="161" facs="tcp:10495:93"/>This forme might ſerue, as often as it ſhould bee neceſſarie that the Legions ſhould march through the countrie one after another, or one alone, not being accompanied with ſome good number of horſemen, if ſo be that they would be prouided againſt the ſurpriſes and ſodaine aſſaults of their enemies, &amp; haue their ſicke and hurt men, and alſo their baggage out of daunger of the ſayd enemies. For that this manner of martching doth require that the way where it ſhould paſſe ſhould be large and euen, and is alſo inuented but to withſtand people that ſhould aſſayle it without keeping order, and at vnwares, to the intent to put thoſe that trauell into diſorder, if they could, or at the leaſt to make their hands with the baggage: the chiefeſt remedie (as I haue aboue ſaid) is to raunge the Souldiers in ſuch order that they might defend themſelues on euery ſide: and alſo haue their baggage in a ſure place, for otherwiſe it would not be poſſible to defend it ſo well if it ſhould bee without the battaile, but that in martching and ſtaying there might be much loſt: wherefore this order of martching, for doubt of our enemies whom we ſee not, is moſt neceſſarie. And it would bee a moſt profitable thing to accuſtome our Legionaries to put themſelues together, and to martch in this order. And vpon the way to take them out of this order, and raunge them according vnto their firſt manner of battaile, or like vnto the others which we haue ſhewed: and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly to bring them againe into the order of martching that is here ſpoken of. Moreouer, to cauſe them to make the tayle of their battailes the head, and the head the tayle: and afterwards to make of either of the two flankes ſometimes the one, and ſometime the other. This done, they may then be raunged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in their firſt order: and it ſhal be neceſſarie to exerciſe them often in theſe exerciſes, if we will haue them to be right good and expert Souldiers: for Militarie diſcipline is nothing elſe but to know how to begin and to execute the things aboue ſayd: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all Captaines and others that haue charge of the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Souldiers ought to take paines. And I beleeue that an hoaſt ſo ordred, ſhould bee alwaies the vanquiſher, and could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer at any time bee broken and vanquiſhed. If ſo bee that the formes aforeſayd do ſeeme any thing hard, it is moſt certaine
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:10495:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that the difficultie will become eaſie enough by meanes of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe. Moreouer, who ſo doth knowe how to raunge an hoaſt and to order them in theſe formes, ſhall knowe the eaſier how to raunge and order an hoaſt in others, which are not altogether ſo hard.</p>

Amongſt all which, there is none greater then this: to weet, to keepe a Camp furniſhed with bread and wine. The auncient Chiefes were not carefull for wine: for when the wine fayled them, they dranke water mingled with a little vineger to giue it colour and ſauour. And amongſt their prouiſions for their hoaſts, there were no ſpeeches made of wine, but only to haue water and vineger. Moreouer, the auncient Souldiers had not their bread baked in ouens, as we haue at this inſtant euery where, but baked cakes themſelues of a certaine quantitie of meale that was deliuered vnto them day by day, out of the ſtore, and beſides that, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine quantitie of larde; and this was all: ſo that the victualls whereof the auncient Chiefes made their prouiſion for the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation of a Campe, was only meale, vineger, and lard for the Souldiers, and barley for the horſes. They had moreouer a great number of cattell both great and ſmall, that followed their Campes; which cattell (for that it needed not to be carted or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, nor likewiſe was fed with any thing that was carried) was not chargeable, nor troubleſome vnto an armie: which was the occaſion in times paſt that their armies went many iournies
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:10495:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
through deſerts and ſolitarie places, without lacke of victualls, for that they liued of victuall that might eaſely follow a Camp.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Turke</hi> his Souldiers neede no wine, becauſe that their lawe doth forbid them to drinke it, and alſo they go long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out eating bread, if ſo be that they may haue water and rice, and ſeldome it is that they do ſuffer want: for they carrie ordinarilie ſackes full of poudered fleſh minſed ſo fine, that it ſeemeth to be a pouder, and to eate this poudered fleſh, they take but a little at a meale, and temper it in warme water, and afterward ſup it vp, and ſo doe the ſayd <hi>Turkes</hi> liue. Moreouer, if they haue great want of victuall, the ſaid fleſh being ſpent, they do let their horſes bloud: for they are almoſt all horſemen, and do liue cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine daies with this bloud. And if ſo be that the famine doe too much oppreſſe them, they do kill their horſes, and eate them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they do forſake to do their Prince loyall ſeruice, and the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt of their power; which our delicate Souldiers will not do: for they will very hardly ſerue one day without they bee in wine vp to the eares, or full crammed readie to burſt: but when I ſay our Souldiers, I meane thoſe that are at this inſtant, but not thoſe that might bee leuied in <hi>Fraunce:</hi> for that they might eaſely be made temperate enough, ſo that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chiefes themſelues would giue them example, and that they were not ſo much gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto diſordinate eating and drinking as they are. The <hi>Scotchmen</hi> (as ſayth <hi>Froiſard</hi>) haue a very good manner to liue in time of warre: for firſt of all they do carrie no prouiſion of bread and wine with them. Moreouer, they content themſelus long time, ſo that they may haue fleſh but halfe ſodden, which they do eate very well without bread, and drinke water. And moreouer, they are not troubled with the carrying of kettles or pannes, becauſe that they do ſee the their fleſh in the ſkinnes of beaſtes when they haue flayed them: nor haue no care to carrie prouiſion with them, becauſe they are ſure to finde in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie where they do pretend to make warre. One thing they haue care of, that is, to carrie a plate of yron, and a bagge of meale, to the intent that when they feele their ſtomackes weake and féeble with the eating of too much rawe fleſh, they might comfort them with cakes, which they do make after this manner. They tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:10495:95"/>
a little meale in a diſh, and caſt their plate into the fire, and when the plate is hot enough, they do make little cakes of their paſte, and bake them vpon the ſayd plate: and by this meanes they do make great iournies to ſurpriſe their neighbours, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rumour of their enterpriſes, and without any great coſt. As for vs <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> we will haue a regard not to liue ſo ſoberly what need ſoeuer there were: for hardly wil we one houre indure the lacke of good wine or good bread, nor of any other daintie, no more then if we were at home in our owne houſes, and that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man were of abilitie to haue all that he deſired. And therfore our armies are quickly famiſhed, as well for that it is hard to make prouiſion for many daies of ſo many things as wee do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, as alſo for the meruelous ſpoyle that are made of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſions when we haue them. Wherefore we muſt reforme our hoaſts after a new manner, that is, neuer to ſuffer men of warre to eate other bread then that they ſhould bake themſelues. And in ſo doing, it ſhould be neceſſarie to furniſh the ſayd Souldiers, euery man with a quantitie of meale, whether it were by gift, or in rebating it vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their wages. As for wine, the General ſhould not trouble himſelfe to prouide any, nor impeach the victuallers from bringing it aboundantly, and yet he ſhould vſe no great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence on his part to cauſe any to be brought vnto the Camp. As for the other prouiſions, they may bee vſed altogether accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto the auncient manner. This doing, all well conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, you ſhall finde that a Lieutenant Generall ſhall free his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of a moſt great charge, and eaſe himſelfe of a great burthen. And to the intent that our Legionaries ſhould finde the want of victualls to bee the leſſe ſtraunge vnto them, if that they ſhould lacke at any time, and that they might paſſe at a neede without wine, and choyſe of meates: I am of opinion, that in going and returning from their muſters they ſhould be forbidden to drinke wine, and to eate bread baked in an ouen, and likewiſe the eating of fleſh, except lard, whereof only I would cauſe prouiſion to be made at the places where they ſhould paſſe &amp; lodge: and for the reſt they ſhould carrie vpon their backs aſmuch meale as ſhould ſerue them during the voyadge, if that they would eate: for other prouiſion I would make them none of any thing.</p>

To treate of the booties that are gotten after the winning of a battaile, or in going through an enemie his countrie, or in getting any towne by aſſault, or by the raunſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the towne or countrie where an armie doth paſſe, and for priſoners that may bee taken: firſt it ſhall not bee amiſſe to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine how the auncient Chiefes did gouerne their armies in the like buſines. And conſider what is the cauſe that the warres at theſe daies do aſwell impoueriſh the Princes that are vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhers, as thoſe which are vanquiſhed: for that if the one do looſe honor, and any part of his lands, the other doth ſpend his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and his goods: which was not ſo in times paſt, becauſe that the vanquiſher enriched himſelfe alwaies with the goods and ſpoyles of his enemies, and at this time we do make no ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of the booties which we do get as they did then: but all is abandoned vnto the Souldiers, which is cauſe of two great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders: the one is that which I haue ſpoken of touching the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouriſhing of a Prince; and the other is, that the Souldiers do become the more couetous to get, and leſſe carefull to keepe the orders of the warres. For many times it hath béen ſeen that the couetouſneſſe of the pillage hath ouerthrowne the vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher: as happened vnto the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> at <hi>Guyngate,</hi> where the victorie was wholly ours, if the <hi>French</hi> Archers had not giuen themſelues vnto pillage; which they payd for dearely, for they loſt all their liues there.</p>

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:10495:96"/>
ſicke and hurt men, and to helpe to ſupport the other charges of the hoaſt. But yet the <hi>Conſull</hi> might ſuffer his men to ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacke, and they did it ſometimes; but it neuer cauſed any diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: for that their enemies hoaſt being ouerthrowne, al the ſpoyle was placed in the middeſt of the armie, and afterward it was diſtributed vnto euery man according vnto his qualitie and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: which manner was cauſe that the Souldiers gaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto the fight, and not vnto pillage: and alſo that the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie bands raunged in the bodie of the Battailon, did not purſue thoſe that fled, but continued faſt in their rankes without daunger: for the light armed men only had the charge to followe the victorie; ſo that if the bootie ſhould haue appertayned vnto thoſe that did firſt gather it vp, it had not béen poſſible nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing vnto equitie to haue kept the battailons in order, &amp; haue giuen others libertie to make their profite. By this meanes the common treaſure augmented merueilouſly, and that was the occaſion that a <hi>Conſull</hi> carried ſo much treaſure at his triumph, hauing gathered it together of his booties and raunſomes. The <hi>Romanes</hi> did alſo another thing with great conſideration, that was, that the one third part of the wages that they gaue month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto euery Souldier, was deliuered into the hands of the Enſigne-bearer, which he might not render vnto them agayne vntill ſuch time as the warres were finiſhed. And this did they, being thereunto mooued by two reaſons, the one was to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that the Souldiers might haue ſome profite of their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: (for being yong men, and without care, the more goods that they had, the more they ſpent without neede) the other reaſon was, that the Souldiers ſhould fight the more reſolutly, &amp; with the better wills defend him that had their goods in keeping. So that by this meanes they became rich and valiant, which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we muſt vſe, and alſo the others before ſpoken of, if we will reduce the exerciſe of the warres into it firſt eſtate. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to ſpeake of the office of a Generall that would ſurely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct an armie marching through an enemie his countrie from place to place: becauſe that ſometimes there may happen many accidences wherein there are great danger: which to withſtand, me thinke that it were requiſit y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a Lieutenant Generall ſhould
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:10495:96"/>
imploy his wittes and his Souldiers their vertues: &amp; therefore it ſhalbe neceſſarie to ſpeake ſomewhat thereof. Wherefore, I ſay that as often as a Lieutenant Generall doth trauell with a great companie or a ſmall, that aboue al things he ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for the ſodaine aſſaults, and ambuſhes of his enemies, into which he may fall two manner of waies: for either he falleth thereinto of himſelfe in trauailing, or elſe he is entiſed thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by his enemies, for lacke of taking heed. To withſtand the firſt manner, it ſhalbe néedfull to ſend out two or thrée troopes of diſcoueries before. The firſt troope ought to be but a ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to runne on the one ſide &amp; the other to diſcouer. The ſecond ſhould be of a reaſonable force to back them, if they ſhould be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayled. And the third ought to be ſtronger then the ſecond, for to reſiſt a good force of their enemies, if that they did méet them in the teeth. And how much the fitter the countrie were for am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhes, as full of woods, hills, and ſuch like; ſo much the greater ſhould the troopes of the diſcouerers be: for ambuſhes are moſt commonly made in a wood, or behind a hill, &amp; ſomtimes in caues and ditches, alongſt the banks of riuers, if they be high enough, ſometimes in vallies and houſes, and behinde olde walls. In briefe, ambuſhes may be laid in all places how little couered ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they be: ſpecially for that footmen may lie down flat vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ground to be the leſſe perceiued. But as an ambuſh where there is no héed taken may do great hurt: ſo being prouided for &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered it can do nothing at all. The foules of the ayre haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times diſcouered ambuſhes, and ſo likewiſe hath the duſt of the ground diſcouered the comming of an enemie, becauſe of the duſt which an armie doth cauſe to riſe in trauailing. <hi>Paulus Aemelius Conſull</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> being to paſſe through a forreſt with his men neere vnto a water, ſeeing a farre of that many foule roſe vp ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly, coniectured that in the water there were men hid; becauſe that the foule roſe wholly afeard &amp; flewe ouer the water to &amp; fro without ceaſſe: he therefore ſending diſcouerers to ſee what it was, and finding that there were 10000. <hi>Bohemians</hi> in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh for to haue ſurpriſed him in paſſage, cauſed his Legions to turne back again, &amp; tooke another way that his enemies doubted not of, &amp; ſurpriſed &amp; ouerthrew them that would haue ſurpriſed
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:10495:97"/>
him. Likewiſe <hi>Thyamenus</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Horeſtes</hi> being aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed that his enemies lay vpon the toppe of a high mountaine, where he and his men ſhould paſſe: hauing ſent to knowe the trueth by his diſcouerers, who reported vnto him that it was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then had béen told him before: as the ſayd <hi>Thyamenus</hi> was procéeding vpon his way, he ſawe a great number of foule riſe from the place that he doubted, which flewe round about not lighting: whereby he vnderſtood of his enemies ambuſh, and ſought another way to paſſe through. As concerning the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond poynt, that is to bee inticed vpon an ambuſh: a Generall ought alwaies to ſtand vpon his guard, and ought neuer to giue credite vnto things that are but like vnto a trueth: as if an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie doth place before him ſome troope of cattle or other thing to pray vpon, he may beléeue that it is but a hooke to catch him with all, and a couering of his deceipt. Likewiſe, if a great number of his enemies Souldiers, ſhould flye before a ſmall number of his men; or that a ſmall number of his enemies dare aſſault a great number of his, he may be aſſured that it is not done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a conſideration. Moreouer, if an enemie do ſodainly flye without cauſe, a Generall may bee aſſured that it hath a ſubtile meaning in it. True it is that theſe things may oftimes be done without thinking of any euill, ſpecially when as they that make theſe ſhewes, haue aſmuch reaſon to doubt on their ſides, as the others on theirs: notwithſtanding, the ſureſt way in theſe caſes, is to take all that is done by the enemie at the worſt, except a man had a moſt certaine aduertiſement. Moreouer, a Generall muſt not beleeue but that his enemie can do his buſines with wiſedome. Wherefore if a Generall would take heed for being deceiued, &amp; endomaged, he ought to eſteeme of his enemie moſt, when he perceiueth him to be weakeſt and worſt counſailed: and in this buſines he muſt vſe two contrarie termes. Firſt of all he ought to doubt his enemie in his owne thought, and in the gouernment of his armie; but to diſpraiſe him in ſpeach, and by all his outward demonſtrations to make ſhewe that he maketh no accompt of him. This doing, the laſt manner will bee an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to animate his Souldiers to conceiue the better hope of the victorie againſt their enemies: and the firſt will make him
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:10495:97"/>
the more wary and aduiſed to kéepe him-ſelfe from ſurprice: which is a thing more then neceſſary, when as a Generall is in an enemy his countrey, becauſe that an army is there a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more in danger, then it may be vppon a day of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile. And therefore he ought to be circumſpect, and ought to haue all the countrey deſcribed vnto him, and platted in ſutch ſort, that he might know all the places in the countrey, diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from one place vnto another, waies, footepaths, mountains, fluds, marſhes, riuers, and all other qualities. And for to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand all this the better, he muſt get thoſe about him that know the countrey, and muſt interogat them ſeuerally from point to point: and afterwards hauing penned their anſwers, he muſt conferre them together, to try whether they be like or contrary. And to be the better aſſured, he muſt ſend out horſemen ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what before into the countrey, and certaine wiſe Chiefes with them, to diſcouer the force and eſtate of his enemies, and to ſée if the deſcription made vnto him by the others, do agrée with the truth. He muſt likewiſe haue a great regard that his guides be ſafe kept, for many times falſe and traiterous guides haue bin the occaſion of the loſſe of many a good man, and ſo likewiſe haue falſe ſpies: of whome, to be well ſerued, he muſt promiſe to giue them great recompence for their paines in doing theyr duties faithfully: and alſo muſt threaten them with death, if that they ſhould faile, and deceiue him: and aboue all things his army muſt neuer know vnto what place he doth determine to bring them: for in all the exerciſe of the warres, there is no one point more profitable, then to kéepe ſecret that which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. And to the intent that an army ſhould not be troubled or aſtonied through any ſodaine aſſault, the ſouldiers ought to be alwayes in a readineſſe to receiue their enemies, that is to ſay, to be aduertiſed and taught what they ſhould do, if that they ſhould be aſſailed either by night or by day, while they reſt, or are vpon the way, for things that are prouided for, do leaſt hurt. We muſt alſo note this aduertiſement to vſe it when as we do trauaile through the countrey, that is, that the one part of the army ſhould not be too farre from the other. And for that ſome do goe ſometimes too faſt, and others too ſlowe, it ſhould
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:10495:98"/>
be néedefull to place certaine expreſſe Chiefes both before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, and betwixt the battailes, who ſhould haue charge to cauſe them to march all of one forme and time, kéeping backe thoſe that goe too faſt, and haſtening thoſe that goe too ſlowly: for if a Generall do not cauſe that to be done, they will fall into a diſorder, which might happen to cauſe their ouerthrowe. Euery man ſhall meaſure his pace according vnto the ſtroke of the Dromme, and ſo their gate will be all one. The ſingle order of euery Legion for the time that they do march together, (I meane when they do march one after another, and that they be farre from enemyes) muſt be 21. men in a ranke, who ſo would raunge the Legions readily in battaile: and therefore there muſt be order giuen that the waies where that they ſhould paſſe, ſhould be at the leaſt broad enough to receiue the ſayd number. A Generall ought alſo to conſider of the cuſtome and qualitie of his enemy, to wéete, whether he vſe to aſſayle in the euening, or in the morning, or in the night, and whether he be ſtrongeſt of footemen, or of horſemen, to the intent to prouide for him.</p>

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:10495:98"/>
he doth ariue at the edge of a riuer, which doth hinder him for want of ready paſſage, ſo that his enemyes may ouertake him whileſt he is at this point, and enforce him to fight, how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing ſoeuer he be. The remedy in this caſe is to imitate the example of <hi>Sertorius;</hi> who hauing his enemies at his héeles, &amp; being ariued at the edge of a riuer which he ſhould paſſe, deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſtay his enemies whilſt he did paſſe to encloſe his Campe with a trench in forme of a halfe Moone, and placed wood and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things apt to burne, round about the ſaid trench, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſet it on fire, the flambe whereof was ſo vehement, that his enemies durſt neuer aduenture to make way through, and by that meanes he paſſed ouer the ſaid riuer at eaſe, and ſaued himſelf. <hi>Pelopidas</hi> of <hi>Thebes</hi> did the like in <hi>Theſſalia. Hanno</hi> being incloſed with his enemies, enuironed the place where he would iſſue out at with a great many fagots, not making any trench at all, and cauſing the wood to be ſet on fire, wherevpon his enemies aſſembling to keepe the other iſſues (for they neuer thought that he could haue paſſed that way) he went through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fire with his people, hauing admoniſhed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they ſhould couer their faces with their targets, &amp; their thighes with their ſkirts. <hi>Quintus Luctatius</hi> being neere purſued of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Cimbres,</hi> &amp; comming vnto the edge of a riuer that he ſhould paſſe, made ſhew to tarry for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſafer paſſage, &amp; faigned to place his Camp there, cauſing trenches to be made, &amp; certaine tents to be raiſed, and ſent out certaine boyes for forrage, by reaſon whereof, the <hi>Cimbres</hi> thought that the <hi>Romanes</hi> would haue lodged all that night in that place, and therefore they camped alſo, deuiding themſelues into many parts, ſome going for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and other ſeeking to recouer victuals, which when <hi>Lucta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> perceiued, he cauſed his forragers ſodainly to be called back againe, and immediatly paſſed the riuer without impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for his enemyes being ſcattered as is ſaid, could not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle him at that inſtant, for they could by no meanes haue béen aſſembled ſo ſodainly to follow him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Craeſus</hi> ſeeing that he could not paſſe through a riuer called <hi>Halis,</hi> and that he had nothing to help himſelfe withall to make a Bridge, cauſed a great ditch to be made, which came from
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:10495:99"/>
the ſaide riuer behinde his Campe: which ditch was made ſo deepe, that all the water in the riuer, or at the leaſt the greateſt part thereof, might iſſue out of the firſt currant into it: which being done, the riuer was drawne ſo lowe, that his ſouldiers paſſed through almoſt dry ſhod. And as for the paſſing through riuers with horſſemen and footemen, that are but of meane deapth, but runne maruellous ſtrong, there is no other thing to be done, but to place the greateſt part of the horſſemen which are beſt mounted, vppermoſt toward the ſtreame, to reſiſt and breake the force of the water, and to place another part beneathe them, leauing a broade paſſage betwixt them, for the footemen and the other worſt horſſes to paſſe through without perill: and if ſo be that the force of the water ſhould ouerthrowe any of them, thoſe that were lowermoſt ſhould ſuccour him, and take him vp. But riuers that are not to be waded through, muſt be paſſed ouer with bridges placed vpon boates: which bridges and boates may be both carted and caryed alongſt with an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye, as we haue ſéene in our time one, which the King cauſed to be made, which was ſtrong ynough to paſſe all carriges, and the great Ordnance paſſed ſurely vpon it alſo, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it was portable, &amp; eaſy to be carted, for one Waggon caryed one of thoſe boates eaſily, and the planks that were layd vpon it. There may be many ſorts of bridges made to paſſe riuers, but that with boates is the ſureſt: and if there ſhould be enemyes on the other ſide of the riuer to impeach the laying of a bridge, or to kéepe the riuer, and to ſtop the paſſage, which oft times doth happen, I do knowe no better remedy therein, then to imitate <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who hauing his Hoaſt at the edge of the riuer to goe into <hi>Auuergne,</hi> perceiuing that <hi>Vercingenberix</hi> did kéepe the other ſide againſt him, who had cauſed all the bridges to be broken, ſo that by that meanes he could not paſſe. He tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed certaine daies alongſt the ſaid riuer, waighting an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie that might helpe him to paſſe: but for that his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes marched on the other ſide of the riuer right againſt him to hinder him for paſſing, <hi>Caeſar</hi> could finde no meanes in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine daies to do it, vntill at length he found a place couered with trées where he lodged: and in the morning he ſtayed in
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:10495:99"/>
that place with part of his army, and ſent the reſt to follow their way, coaſting the riuer as they did before: and this he did to the intent to repayre a Bridge there which was broken but a fewe dayes before: and when his enemyes were diſlodged, <hi>Caeſar</hi> fell to worke: for <hi>Vercingentrix</hi> thinking that the <hi>Romans</hi> had béen altogether, continued his way, and neuer perceiued <hi>Caeſar</hi> his policy, vntill the Bridge was layed and fortified. Let vs alſo ſpeake of the incloſing of an army betwixt two high Mountaines, where there is but two iſſues to paſſe through, to wéete, that before the ſaid army and the other that it is entred in at: and let vs ſuppoſe that both theſe wayes the army being entred are ceazed vpon by their enemies, and the tops of the Mountaynes alſo: the beſt remedy in this caſe is, to make a great ditch toward that iſſue that the army is entred at, to the intent that their enemyes might thinke that it were done to ſtop thoſe behinde them from aſſaulting them, whileſt they did aſſay to open the paſſage before them: and to confirme theyr enemyes the better in this opinion, they may make ſhewe to march forward to repulſe thoſe that keepe the paſſage before them: and it will be a great chaunce but that both thoſe that are behinde, and thoſe vpon the Mountaynes, will make haſte to ſuccour the others at the place where they thinke that the army will ſeeke paſſage: and if ſo be that they do forſake the place where the army entred, there is no more to be done, but ſpeedely to make paſſage ouer the ditch, and to returne that way that they are entred. After this manner eſcaped <hi>Pericles</hi> from the <hi>Peloponeſians. Quintus Fabius, Conſull</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> being incloſed in the Mountaynes of <hi>Genes,</hi> not knowing how to get out, except he might helpe himſelf with ſome policie, ſent a good company of his <hi>Numidian</hi> horſemen towards one of the ſtraights that his enemies kept, who at the firſt ſight ranked themſelues in battaile, to keepe the paſſage againſt them: but ſeeing that the <hi>Numidians</hi> did make no great ſhewe, or to be of no great force to winne the paſſage: and that they were in poore eſtate, and their Horſſes verie leane, they made ſo little accoumpt of them, that a great part of thoſe that had the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in charge went home, and others ſtoode gaping vpon the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:10495:100"/>
                        <hi>Numidians</hi> expreſſely to ſée them: wherevpon the ſaid <hi>Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> perceiuing the euill order and little accoumpt that theyr enemies did make of them, pricked their horſſes all at once, and charged theyr ſayd enemies ſo violently, that they paſſed through the ſtraight, and after that they were paſt, they ranne vpon the countrey to ſpoile it, ſo that their enemies were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to leaue the paſſage open for the ſayd <hi>Conſull</hi> and his men to reſkue their owne goodes which the ſaid <hi>Numidians</hi> did make ſpoile of.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> as he marched in retyring out of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of the <hi>Parthians</hi> where <hi>Craſſus</hi> had béene newly ſlaine, ſeeing that his enemyes did aſſayle him ordinarily earely in the morning, and ſkirmiſhed and troubled him all day long, vntill that he lodged, and that then they let him alone, and lodged themſelues farre from his Campe: to paſſe the reſt of his way with the leſſe trouble, he determined one day not to diſlodge vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it was very late, and did ſo: wherevpon the <hi>Parthians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſlodged, and ſéeing that the <hi>Romanes</hi> remained in their Campe, thinking that they would not haue ſturred that day, returned againe vnto their lodging, and <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued immediatly after, and had leiſure ynough to march all the reſt of that day without trouble. In this place I muſt make mention of one thing which his ſouldiers did through his counſaile, to couer themſelues from the great number of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes that the <hi>Parthians</hi> did ſhoote amongſt them, that was, as often as the ſaid <hi>Parrhians</hi> did charge them, they knéeled downe vpon one knée, and thoſe of the ſecond ranke did lay their targets vpon the heads of thoſe of the firſt ranke, and thoſe of the third vpon the heads of thoſe of the ſecond ranke: and thoſe of the fourth vpon the heads of thoſe of the third, and ſo follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing, ſo that all the ranks were couered as if it had been vnder
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:10495:100"/>
a roofe, which manner might be obſerued by our Legionaries, by meanes of their targets, if ſo be that at any time they were in danger of archers. During the warres with the <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> Shields were in vſe, which at this inſtant would not be ill ſo that a Harquebuſſe could not pearce them, for to haue one ranke of men that ſhould carry them before the battailes, to the intent that the firſt ranks of the battailes might continue whole, when as they ſhould come hand to hand with their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes. I will not forget in this place, this one rule of the ſcience of the warres, which is of great importance, that is, to make ouerture and paſſage for an enemy on ſome one ſide, when as he is ſo incloſed, that he can eſcape no way, except a man haue ſome great aduantage of them: for it is to be feared that they would do ſome great miſchiefe, ſeeing themſelues out of hope: for that all good Souldyers, which do make theyr reckoning to dye but once, will ſell their liues ſo deare, that the remembrance of it may continue long after: and ſometimes this deſperation is cauſe of their ſafety that are in this danger, becauſe that then they do make of neceſſitie, a vertue: as the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> did at the battaile of <hi>Poytiers,</hi> where they were but a handfull of people incloſed by a great number of <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> who would take no reaſonable compoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at their hands: wherefore as men out of hope to eſcape from the place, the ſaid <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> ſtoode all vpon this reſolution, that it was more honor for them to be ouerthrowne in fighting vertuouſly, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that they ſhould all dye) then to eſcape, and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached euer after: and vpon this deliberation they fought ſo well, that the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> who were tenne to one, were fouly ouerthrowne, and King <hi>Iohn</hi> taken. Therefore in ſuch a caſe it is good to be ſomewhat gratious, ſpecially when we are at that point y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our enemies muſt defend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues of méere force: for it were better to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> paſſage vpon ſome one ſide, and by that meanes to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome hope to ſaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, &amp; the leſſe will to reſiſt, then by thinking to ouerthrow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quite, to fall into the danger to be ouerthrown, or to léeſe many men: for this paſſage which I ſpeake of is not to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> leaue to depart for altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but is to haue a better meane to breake the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in thinking
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:10495:101"/>
to ſcape quite and out of danger, euery one of thoſe that would defend themſelues ſtoutly, being conſtrained therevnto, would not ſéeke or hearken to any other thing, but how to ſaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: wherefore they would all thinke to eſcape, ſome one way, and ſome another: and in this doing they would breake, for as much as euery man would haue care but of himſelfe. A Generall ought likewiſe to let an enemy his army to paſſe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſéemeth to be ſtrong ynough to defend it ſelfe in the playne field, and doth forſake the place without fighting, miſtruſting it ſelfe not to be ſtrong ynough, or dare not ſtay the comming of their enemyes: for the departure only is greatly for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, vnto whome the place is left: and how much more ſecretly that his enemyes do depart, ſo much the greater is his credit that doth feare them away. It is well knowne what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat that the <hi>Spanyards</hi> did make at their departure from <hi>Troy,</hi> without ſounding Trompet or Dromme, and that the ſaid retreat was as great an honor vnto <hi>Mounſieur de Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trec,</hi> as almoſt the victorie would haue bin. And that he looked into before, which was the occaſion that he conſtrained not his enemies for to fight, leaſt that he ſhould haue fallen into any danger by that conſtraint: alſo to ſhew apparantly that his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies were no wayes equall vnto him, he did not force them ſo much as to amend their gate: and being aduertiſed time y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of their flying, and perſwaded to purſue them, he aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered with <hi>Scipio,</hi> that a man ought not only to leaue the way frée before his enemies to flye, but alſo to amend and open it. This matter requireth that we ſhould héere ſpeake of another great point, that is, how an Hoaſt might retyre from another, when as it feeleth it ſelfe too weake to fight with an enemy, or to abide his comming: for all good Captaines affirme, that in all the actions of the wars, there is none more dangerous. For that when a Generall doth retire without Combat, being néere vnto his enemies, he doth take away the valew of his ſouldiers, and giue it vnto their enemies: but ſo it is that theſe things do happen oft ynough, and therefore I will ſhew how we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire with the leaſt daunger. Aboue all things the ſouldiers may not knowe that their Generall doth retire to auoide the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate:
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:10495:101"/>
but they muſt be made to beleeue that the retreat is made to draw their enemies into ſome other more commodious place, to haue a more aduantage of them: or that it is doone to make theyr enemies to follow them, to bring the ſaide enemies vpon ſome ambuſh: for who ſo would not alledge vnto his Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſome reaſon lyke a truthe for his ſudden departure, ſhould make them to thinke that theyr Generall dooth retyre for the feare that he hath of his enemies, being out of hope of his abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to reſit them if he ſhould come vnto the combate: by means whereof, they would fall into ſuch a feare, that how little force ſo euer their enemies ſhould doe vnto them, they would imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly flye, cheefely if it were by night: for the prouerbe is, that ſhame ſhutteth hir eyes by night, and ſeeth not one iotte. We muſt therefore in ſuch caſes diſlodge ſo ſtilly, that our enemies doe not perceiue it, for it would be to be doubted, that in the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Campe they would giue vs an aſſault, in which doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, thoſe which before were in feare, would by &amp; by put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues into diſorder: therefore they that heeretofore haue béene conſtrained to vſe ſuch retreats, placed their Horſſemen vpon two ſides like vnto two hedges: and left awaye betwixt them, through which way their footmen did retyre being couered with their Horſſemen, ſo that they could not bee perceiued by theyr enemies. And after this maner they cauſed their battailes to paſſe one after another: and when one battaile was eſkaped, it fortified it ſelfe in ſome place out of the enemie his ſight, ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whileſt the others came, who retyred in like manner as the firſt did: and in the end all the armie did put themſelues in ſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. We muſt note, that if this were doone by day, that it ought to be in ſome couered place, or plaine countrie: for how little a hill ſoeuer that their enemies might haue vpon their ſide, they might eaſily diſcouer this departing. The order that an armie obſerued heeretofore in remoouing by night, was this: firſt of all, after it was determined what waye that they ſhould take to ſaue themſelues, and at what crie or ſound of the Trumpet that they ſhould be ready to depart, the Generall ſent a good num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of light armed men before, (as we would ſay the Forlorne hope, which I haue appointed in this woorke,) to ceaze vpon
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:10495:102"/>
all the places of aduantage, and of all the ſtraights that the Campe ſhould paſſe through in retyring: and when the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall thought that they had ceazed vpon them all, hee then ſet foorth with the reſt of his armie, and followed the firſt with as little noyſe as might bee poſſible. Now if his enimies vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of this departure, they immediatlye vſed all the diligence poſſible to ceaze vpon the paſſages which were taken before, and kept by the light armed men, not breaking their order: &amp; if they were followed in this retreat, the reſt of the light armed men that were with the armie (for it is to bee vnderſtood they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining with them the one halfe or more) kept at the tayle, and vpon the flankes with the Horſſemen: who reſiſted their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with all their power, ſkirmiſhing in retyring, not ſtayeng long in a place, but following the battailes as neare as they could: as for to ſtay behind them there were no great wiſdome, and with theſe ſkirmiſhes both the Battailes and they went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde vpon their waye, being little endamaged by their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, nor hindered to arriue at the paſſages that their men kept for them.</p>
                     <p>At which paſſages when they were arriued, hauing all their men together they incamped: if the place were fit to doe it, and that they knew an aduantage by it, and might haue in it things neceſſarie for them without daunger, and might bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeued in deſpight of their enemies, or elſe they paſſed further: and their light armed men that were before at the tayle of their battailes, marched now at the front, and all the hoaſte followed them, and thoſe who had kept the paſſages before, who were freſh, and had reſted, kept at the tayle, to maintaine ſkirmiſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their enemies, whileſt the others did goe theyr wayes, they themſelues following them, ſkirmiſhing, and reſiſting theyr enemies all daye long, vntill ſuch time as they did come vnto theyr lodging. And this is concerning thoſe that doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre in the ſight of theyr enemyes, which is more harde, then when as they doe depart, not beeing diſcouered in a good while after that they are remooued, or vntill the next daye: for in ſuch a caſe they ſhall haue time enough to get away farre enough off from their enemies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="179" facs="tcp:10495:102"/>And thoſe that would ſo dilſlodge, that theyr enemies being neare ſhould not perceiue it, ought to vſe all the meanes that they may poſſible, to make their enemies to thinke, that they do ſtill remaine in their fort, they muſt diſlodge by night, &amp; their fyers muſt bee refreſhed that they ſhould not goe out in long time after their departure: but continue burning vntill it were day. Moreouer they muſt place the bodies of their dead if they haue any, round about their trenche: which ſhould bee vnderſet with ſhoores, and clothed and weapened as if they were alyue: or they ſhould plant ſome buſhes, and clothe them with Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers apparell: or ſtuffe the ſayde clothes with graſſe, and leaue certaine head peeces placed vpon the trenche, layeng ſtakes by them, with matche burning, for to repreſent Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſiers: the one of theſe deuiſes will ſerue by night, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by daye.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, they might leaue Dogges, Bullockes, Aſſes, and Horſſes made faſt within their Campe: whoſe cryeng, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng, and howling, might make theyr enemies to beléeue that the Campe were not remooued: and Cockes alſo would doe the like (if there were anye in the Campe: the <hi>Almaignes</hi> doe carrye good ſtore) I thinke not but theſe policies would couer the departing of an armie. And when as the Ordnaunce could not be ſaued, it might bee broken in péeces, and carryed away to be new melted afterward, or might bee buried ſo, that it might afterwarde bee hard to be founde: or if it ſhould come vnto the woorſt it coulde bee but loſte, although it ſhould fall into our enemyes handes: the loſſe whereof coulde not bee ſo great, but the loſſe that might fall vpon the men would bee more to bee feared: becauſe that Ordnance might be eaſier re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered then the men that would bee loſte to defende it: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding at this daye wee doe make ſuch accoumpt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue it, that we doe almoſt forget all our other buſines, making our accoumpt that if it maye bee ſaued it is all that wee doe care for: and that if it were left behinde, all were loſte: for which cauſe wee leaue oft times to giue order for many things of great importance, being troubled with a great quantitie of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:10495:103"/>
Ordnance, which may not be left without a great gard to kéepe it: notwithſtanding the eſtimation that we doe make of it, if it were requiſite for an army to make any extreame haſt, whether it were to indomage an enemy, or to kéepe vs from their hands: through theſe occaſions we muſt eyther abandon the ſaid Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or doe our buſines ill, as we did ours at <hi>Landrian,</hi> for the deſire that we had for to ſaue a naughtie Cannon. Wherefore as often as we are in this extremitie, it were much better for to ſaue the men (albeit that the ordnance, baggage, &amp; other mooue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables, ſhould be loſt) then to hazard men for a thing that may ſo eaſily afterward be recouered. Sithe I haue before ſpoken of a retreat made in the ſight of an enemie, I will now ſpeake of a retreat made which an enemie dooth not ſee. Let vs put caſe that a Generall dooth retyre by night ſo ſecretlye that his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies doe not perceiue his going, vntill long time after his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodging: it is to be thought that in ſhort time he will bee farre on his way, and ſo far as it were not poſſible for his enemies to ouertake him, what haſt ſoeuer they ſhould make: whether they ſhould purſue him, or might purſue him if they would, the ſayd Generall can vſe no better counſell then to trauaile daye and night without reſt, vntill ſuch time as he were out of daunger, &amp; in reſting by the way, to take great héed not to be one minute of an hower without good watch, nor without Horſſemen, ſkout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out vpon the wayes a good waye of from his Campe, and not ſuffer his Souldiers to goe out of their quarter: but to be ready with their armes at euerye hower for to reſiſt thoſe that would aſſayle them, and to ſet forward vpon the waye when they ſhould depart: and this order muſt bee kept at the meales that they doe make by daye: and as concerning their night re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, it muſt be as ſhort as it may be poſſible, the Souldiers ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing continually their armes in their hands: that euery man might bee readye to defende himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>If the ſtay that they did make by night ſhould bee anye thing long, I would counſell the Generall to lodge his men in ſome ſtrong place of aduantage: but the ſureſt and ſafeſt waye is not to ſtaye: but to winne grounde as much as he may poſſible:
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:10495:103"/>
thinking vpon the daunger that he was in but a little before, and the daunger and greefe it would bee vnto him to bee ouertaken through his owne default. It were therefore better for him to vſe diligence, whilſt he may doe it without let, then to tarry the comming of his enemies, and to bee conſtrained to fight, or to fall into their mercie: this dooing he ſhall ſaue himſelfe and his people, and giue his enemie no time to ouertake him, or to force him to fight: but the purſuer muſt take heed, leaſt in purſuing fooliſhly &amp; raſhly he fall into the ambuſhes that are made in ſuch caſes againſt the purſuers, who oft times become ſo audacious, that they doe thinke ſcorne to foreſee into anye thing that might hurte them: ſo that thoſe whome they doe purſue might eaſilye ſurpriſe, and greatlye endomage them: and ſometime put them vtterlye into diſorder, if the Lieutenant Generall who is purſued be a man any thing hardy and aduenterous: into which inconuenience they doe ſometimes fall that are fulleſt of pollicy: but thoſe good Chiefes which will auoide it, purſue as coldlye as they can, &amp; the colder that they doe purſue, the more they doe ſtaye the gate of their people: which ſtaye dooth giue them the more leaſure to get a way that doe retyre. Moreouer it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be too ſlowe in this buſines then too haſtie: for thoſe that doe retyre, haue many wayes to annoye them that doe purſue them, ſpecially if their way doe lye through a ſtrong countrey, or forreſt, for that they may cut downe trées, and fell them croſſe the wayes: and likewiſe may laye ambuſhes, which they may make vnto their aduantage, being in ſtrong and couered places, and in wayes fit for ambuſhes: which ſayde ambuſhes muſt be made by thoſe that are the beaſt footmen, or if that they ſhould make ambuſhes of Horſſemen, they muſt bee of thoſe that are beſt mounted, to the intent they might retyre in ſafetie when they haue executed their charge: &amp; in their ambuſhes they muſt not tarry or ſtaye to long behinde the hoaſt, leaſt theyr enemies perceiuing them ſhould cut them off from the armie. But if the retreat be wiſely handled, the troopes not ſtaying too long behind the armie, the purſuers ſhall be in daunger to take more hurte through their purſute, then thoſe that doe retire through their retreat: for the retirers ſhall better ſuccour one another at their
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:10495:104"/>
néede being néere together, then thoſe that do purſue vndiſcréet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he that beſt may faſteſt. And if that thoſe that retyre doe dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently take héede of theſe ſmall points, and doe ceaze vpon the troubleſome paſſages through which they muſt paſſe, betime not delaying vntill that their enemies ſhould get them: it is to be hoped that they ſhould ſaue themſelues in deſpighte of their enemies, except that ſome other inconuenience doe happen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them vpon the way, which muſt be foreſéene into after one of the maners ſpoken of before, in ſhewing the meanes that a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall might vſe to eſkape fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a dangerous place. And although I had not ſpoken of all the perils into which they may fall ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that doe exerciſe the warres: I ſuppoſe that hauing ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the moſt commoneſt, a Generall Chiefe (if he bee ought worth) will finde a remedie of himſelfe for the other. In the maner aforeſayde in mine opinion maye thoſe retyre that finde themſelues too weake to abide the aduenture of a battaile. On the contrarye part if the purſuers haue kept ſo ill watche that they haue not vnderſtood of their enemies departing, vntill that they were gone a good part of their way: there is no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medye but to take paines to repayre that negligence by ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes. But if it were ſo that they did before hand vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand of their determination to depart, they ſhould ſéeke to ceaze the paſſages, and to breake them with trenches, and to fell trees in their wayes, or other things that might trouble the paſſage. And muſt moreouer keepe their Battailons in good order rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to fight, and the hoaſt readye to depart at all times, and to haue them the readier, to cauſe them to eate their meate as they ranged in Battaile not breaking their order, to the intent that they might be readye to aſſaile their enemies, at what time ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer that they ſhould make ſhew to put themſelues vpon the waye, for to follow them at the héeles, and to incloſe them at the paſſages which are ſtopt and ceazed vpon before. And if ſo be that the countrie were ſo open that there could be no meanes found to ſtoppe them vpon the waye, me thinkes that in this caſe there were no waye to ſtaye them, but to charge them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde thicke and often: and to trouble them in ſuch ſort that the hindmoſt ſhould be conſtrained to ſtay to defend themſelues, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:10495:104"/>
the formoſt to ſuccour them: and thoſe charges ſhould be made by the Harquebuſiers a Horſſebacke, and by the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goletiers, amongſt whome there ſhould bee a good part of the Forlorne hope, or ſome other extraordinary bands, if there were anye at that time in the Campe. And if the enemie were too ſtrong of Horſſemen for theſe ſkirmiſhes, then part of the light Horſſemen muſt bee ſent to ſuccour them: and the battailes muſt marche diligently in verye good order to fight with theyr enemies, with the lighteſt Ordnance that they haue, leauing theyr heauieſt in ſome ſtronge place, and alſo their baggage to make the more haſte, that nothing might hinder them to purſue their enemies, nor to fight with them when they haue ouerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them.</p>
                     <p>And when as the ſayde enemies are diſlodged ſo ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye that they are ſo farre vpon the waye before it bee knowne, that by no meanes they may bee ouertaken in a whole daye: I knowe no other remedie but to follow them, and that the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall who purſueth, doe it wiſelye ſtanding alwayes vpon his guarde, that he fall not into his enimies ambuſhes: and in perſuing them, it may happen that his enemies will thinke, that they are eſkaped out of his handes, and become ſo negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues that they will giue him time enough to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them, &amp; peraduenture be the occaſion of their owne ruine: for thoſe who thinke to be in ſafetie, and are careleſſe to looke vnto theyr buſineſſe, doe oft tymes tryfle awaye the tyme vpon the waye for ſmall occaſion, and thereby are ouertaken, and ſometymes they are founde out of order, whileſt that they doe eate, or ſleepe: as our men were at <hi>Brignolle,</hi> or are out of theyr quarters heere and there for forrage: as ſometime hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened vnto <hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Romane</hi> in <hi>Calabria,</hi> and vnto manye others both before and ſince, &amp; will happen: except that he that retyreth, foreſee before all things to kéepe good watch on euery ſide, and to fortifie himſelfe where he meaneth to ſtay any tyme: if it were but to withſtande the aſſaultes that hys enemy might attempt againſt him euery hower, which is a thing that ought one bothe ſides to bee looked into: for the purſuer is as much ſubiect vnto this inconuenience, as hee that dooth retyre:
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:10495:105"/>
ſpecially if their enemies haue any ſpies whom they may intrap, for that of force thoſe which doe purſue others haſtily, do wearie themſelues with the great iourneys that they do make, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wearied and tyred, they will haue the leſſe regarde of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: by which meanes the others who haue alreadye gotten the aduantage of the waye, are at libertye to goe forward, or to ſtay, and therefore may do eyther of them which they will.

Concerning the ordering of it; that dooth depend vpon the induſtrye of the Lieutenant Generall: and as for the making of it ſtrong, it is the ſcituation, and arte that dooth it. Wee haue a cuſtome at this day to lodge in no place except there be ditches or riuers, or a great number of trees or mountaines: or ſome other naturall rampar that doe make the place ſtrong of it ſelfe. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I finde that the <hi>Romanes</hi> vſed a farre better manner: for they regarded not ſo much the ſtrength of a place that was naturallye ſtronge, as to place their Campe where that they might helpe themſelues by their arte, in which they truſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all things: and ſildome would they campe in any place, how ſtrong ſo euer it were, if it were not large enough to range all their Battailes in, according vnto their militarie diſcipline, in which dooing they might alwaies keepe one ſelfe ſame forme of lodging: for the place was ſubiect vnto them, and not they vnto the place. But we which do obſerue no generall rule heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:10495:105"/>
are conſtrained to make our Campe of many fourms: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to make it crooked, at other times to make it triangular; of too great a length, or round, or ſquare, acording vnto the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation which ſeldom doth fall out fit. And if we ſhould remoue our Camps often, and march ſometime amongſt mountaines, and ſometimes through plaines, and change our maner of lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and the fourmes of our Camps as often as wee doe finde the ſituations far to differ; wee ſhould not onely faile in thys poinct, but alſo (which is worſe) order our Campes with in ſo groſly, that almoſt nothing ſhould be placed in his right place, nor to purpoſe, ſo that a man might thinke our Camps rather to ſhewe vs to bee a confuſed aſſemblie and without order, then to bee men of warre orderly gouerned, whiche is a thing of no leſſe importance, then to make a campe ſtrong round about: for as the fortreſſe doth ſerue to defend men againſt the aſſaults of their enemies, ſo the well ordering of a Campe within, ſerueth for to diſtribute &amp; place them, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euery one might know what part he ſhould defend: without which order we had need to make Bulwarkes and Trenehes about a Campe; for we may better want this Fortification, then the defence that the Souldiers may make within it, who beeing lodged as they ought to bee, may for a neede paſſe without fort, and bee alwaies in order to reſiſt all aſſaults.</p>
                     <p>There are alſo many other ſmall things requiſit, beſides the ſtrength of the place, and the orderlye diſtribution of the people that ſhould keepe it: for in the placing of a Campe there muſt be reſpect had of more then one thing: for not only ought a man to be carefull to be ſurely defended againſt his enemies, but alſo to haue a care that it may bee delectable within, and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for all neceſſarie vſes, ſo that the pleaſantnes of the place might delight the people, for by that meanes it doth kéep them the better, &amp; dooth make them leſſe wearie of it, then when as it ill quallited &amp; diſtributed, as we do ſee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our Camps are: which are moreouer ſo fowl and ſtincking, how litle ſoeuer they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new in a place, that the aier is by &amp; by corrupted, wherof do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede afterwardes plagues and other greeuous diſeaſes, which wee do ſee to raigne amongeſt vs when wee are in Campe.

God doth know the delight that men haue to bee in them, and whether the Souldiers doe no tarye in them oft times againſt their wills, how great a deſier ſoeuer that they haue to followe the warres. Wherefore we ought to order and deuide a campe in ſuch ſort that it might keepe them from ſicknes that ſhoulde dwell in it, and faſhion it ſo wel, that the commoditie and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantnes of the ſame, might make the ſouldiers the more willing for to tarye in it. And for that we cannot finde places ordinarily ſo well ſcituated, as to bee both ſtrong and delectable of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: wee muſt therefore vſe induſtrie to ſupply that by labor, which the ſcituation wanteth. As for the fortifieng of a Campe, we do take as great paines as is poſſible to doo: but wee leaue our Camps within, ſomewhat confuſed. Wherfore I am deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ſpeake mine opinion in this matter, and to lodge my fower Legions, whom I haue conducted hithertoo, with al their carriages and followers, who are in all <hi>24400.</hi> ordynarye footmen, and <hi>2500.</hi> horſemen, not counting the principall chiefes, and officers of the Campe, and their traine, nor like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the ordnance, prouiſion, baggage, nor other followers, which Campe ſhalbe great enough to lodge them all, and more then they, if need were.</p>
                     <p>After that we haue choſen the place where the armie ſhall be lodged, wee muſt beginne in the verie middeſt of the ſame, and there plant a Halbard, and mark round about the ſayd Halbard a ſquare place, which ſhalbe <hi>170.</hi> paces in length, and aſmuch in breadth, with fower ſides, euerye ſide towardes his region. This ſaid ſquare muſt be deuided into fower other ſquares, ech one of them containing <hi>65.</hi> paces, euery way making a croſſe in the middeſt of them, which may ſerue for a ſeperation of the one place from the other: and likewiſe for a ſtreat which ſhalbe <hi>40.</hi> paces in breadth. The one of theſe ſquares muſt ſerue to lodge the General chiefe of the hoaſt, and his gard: another ſhal ſerue for the Captaine Generall of the footmen, and for al thoſe that do follow him without wages. The Captaine Generall of the horſemen ſhalbe lodged in the third, and his prouoſt: &amp; thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> follow him for their pleaſure. The fourth ſhalbe for the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall of the Campe, the Chauncelour, chiefe Treaſurer, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtermaiſters,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:10495:106"/>
and Controwlers, euery one of which fower quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters may be encloſed within a ſmall trenche. And for the lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Legions, wee muſt beginne and ſtreatch a line from the aforeſayd Halbard towards the eaſt, which muſt be <hi>600.</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces long, and another towardes the weſt of the ſame length; ſo that theſe lines maye paſſe through the midſt of the ſtreat which I haue before ordained within the fower ſmall quarters aboue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
                     <p>There muſt likewiſe two other lines be ſtretched from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaid Halbard; the one towardes the South, and the other towardes the North, and of the ſame length that the others are: at the endes of which lines, ſhall the fower gates of the Campe bee, the which ſhal take their names of the Regions towards which they do ſtand. The principall ſtreates ſhalbe laide out along theſe fower lines, and ſhal keepe that bredth I haue giuen vnto the camps that do lodge the legions by themſelues, to wit, <hi>60.</hi> paces euery one.</p>
                     <p>I muſt alſo take from euery one of the Legions, one of theyr fower quarters deſcribed in their camps where they are lodged by themſelues, and turne thoſe fower quarters into voyd pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and thoſe quarters ſhall be taken from the horſmen, ſo that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> horſemen that lodged in thoſe quarters ſhalbe lodged with the other bandes of their Legions. Then the horſemens quarter ſhall bee deuided like vnto one of thoſe wherein the footmen are lodged: in which quarter, two bandes ſhall haue roume enough, without peſtring horſe or man. The Colonels lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſhal continew in their firſt ſtate, and alſo three of the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Legion. So that then I may ſay that the firſt Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall haue his quarter betwixt the Eaſt and the South gate. And the ſecond ſhall haue his betwixt the ſaide Eaſt, and North gate. The thirde legion ſhalbe lodged betwixt the South &amp; the Weſt gates. And the fourth betwixt the Weſt, and the North gate. So that theſe fower legions ſhall furniſh the circuit of the camp, hauing in the midſt of them their Generall and principal chiefs, &amp; on the outſide of them a rampar with many bulwarks defending eche other, betwixt which rampar &amp; their lodgings, muſt be a ſpace left round about the campe of <hi>160.</hi> paces broad
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:10495:107"/>
which ſhall ſerue to place the ordnaunce in, and the watche, &amp; to raunge the Legions in battaile if need were, and alſo to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize the Souldiers in. The Souldiers maye likewiſe put the cattle of their booties there, and Victualers may keepe al theirs by night, if ſo be that they be of our owne natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for els I would put them out of the forte, or into ſome place out of the daunger of their enemies, becauſe that they ſhould not know after what manner I did keepe my watch, nor likewiſe ſee the quantitie of mine ordnance, nor ſhould approch neere the place where I do keepe my prouiſion.</p>
                     <p>To be ſhort, this diſtance betwixt the rampar and the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, may ſerue for to keepe the Campe from burning by fier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes that thoſe without might throwe in, which is a thing eaſie enough to be done, and may trouble a camp maruelouſly. Concerning the fower quarters which I tooke from the Legy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I do meane to imploy them for the common vſe of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: and firſt, that quarter that I tooke from the horſemen of the firſt Legion, ſhall be for the prouiſion of the ordnaunce, to witte, for powder and ſhot, which quarter ſhalbe inuironed with two or three trenches, and there muſt no fier be ſuffered to come neere but as far of as may poſſible. The quarter that was taken from the ſecond legion, ſhall ſerue for all the ſmithes in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: by whome the maiſter of the ordnance ſhall lodge, and hys Gunners, Pioners, Carters, and other attendants vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. As for the quarter of the third legion, I doe ordaine it for the prouiſion of victuall and armes, and for the market to ſel ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell in. In one corner of this quarter ſhall thoſe bee lodged that come in Ambaſſage vnto the Generall, and all others of whom there is any doubt to be had, who ought to bee forbidden aſſoone as they doe ariue, not to go through, or about the campe, nor to ſtur out of their quarter, without being conducted by one of the Trumpeters of the ſaid General, or by ſome other whome hee ſhold appoint. Likewiſe the Generall muſt forbid, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> none of his hoaſt ſhould haue conference with them in any manner, whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it were, except it were thoſe that were appointed to keepe them company, or ſuch as had leaue expreſly. The fourth quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhalbe to keepe the market for al neceſſaries: as bread, wine,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:10495:107"/>
wheat, oates, hay, and other victuals. The butchery ſhalbe kept there alſo, I meane not that the beaſts ſhould be killed there, for no man muſt bee ſo bould as to kill, fley, or open a beaſt within the Campe, nor to burie horſe, dogge, nor any other thing that may ſmell il: nor go to hie buſines in the long publike ſtreats, nor in the perticular little ſtreates, (I tearme them to bee little ſtreats that are amongeſt the quarters) nor no where els, but in certaine holes which euerye one ſhall make in his quarters but it were better that they ſhould go without the Campe, and when as any one ſhould do the contrarie, hee ought to bee grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly punniſhed: and if any ſkorner, do laugh at my words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that I do ſpeake of thoſe ſtincking thinges; I aunſwere him, that he was neuer in campe: or if he were, it hath not bene when as the campe hath ſtaied long in one place, for hee woulde quicklie haue perceiued what hurt infection doth vnto a campe, and negligence in cauſing foule &amp; vncleane things to be throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en farre without a campe. And herof the ruine of that campe, that <hi>Mounſieur de Lautrec,</hi> had before <hi>Naples</hi> can witneſſe, which periſhed through a plague, that was engendered of the corruption of the ayre which was infected through the carrian, and panches of beaſts that were left here and there in the camp vnburied: which negligence, brought vs the plague, and finallie our ruine, and in mine opinion, wee ought to put the fault in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els whatſoeuer we do ſay. The places taken from the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions being imployed to the vſe of the campe, we muſt appoinct the ſtreats for their vſe that do followe the armie, and place eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one of them in a place by himſelfe: to wit, in the eaſt ſtreate, the ſhop-keepers, tailers, hoſiers, and ſhomakers, in the Weſt ſtreat, the taphouſes, cooks, bakers, pi-makers, and ſuche like ſellers of victuals. In the ſouth ſtreat, the Phiſitions, Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries, chirurgeons, Barbers, Chandelers, &amp; pouther-makers. And the north ſtreat ſhalbe for Sadlers, Spurmakers, Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and other their like. And theſe people muſt lodge all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longſt the ſaid ſtreates hindering their breadth as little as they may, &amp; one lodging muſt not be any thing before another. The gates (as I haue ſaid) ſhalbe at the ends of the ſtreats, &amp; ſhalbe ſhut with bars, and the trenches that are round about the camp,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:10495:108"/>
may be commonly three paces broad, and two deepe: and if the enemies did lie neare, they might be made much broder and dée<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>per, or if ſo be that the campe ſhould ſtay long in one place with out remoouing, and the earth of the ſame Trench muſt bee caſt inward, and the corners of the Trench and fort muſt be laid out in the fourme of Bulwarkes, and at diuers other places, ſo that there may bee bulwarkes and flankes round about, and by that meanes I dare ſay, that the Trench of the Campe ſhall be ſtrong enough to reſiſt the enemie his aſſaultes without, and within it will ſhew like a little Citie, equally deuided, and apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtributed, aſwell for the lodgings, as for the publike places, ſo that to liken it wholly vnto a Citie, there would be no other difference, but that the ſtuffe whereof the walles and houſes are built would bee different, for the one is mooueable, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do not ſturre from their place, for in the other points they haue many things alike: and alſo a campe muſt be gouerned by lawes as a Citie is.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, it muſt haue a certaine number of Magiſtrates &amp; officers to gouerne it. I will ſpeake hereafter of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawes, but now I muſt ſpeake ſummarilie; yet orderly of the charge that the chiefes and principall officers ought to exerciſe in a campe. And touching the General of the armie, for aſmuch as I haue promiſed that this ſecond booke ſhoulde whollie concerne hym, therefore I will not mingle him with the other. The Chiefes whereof, I will ſpeake heere are theſe: the Captaine Generall of the footmen, the Captaine Generall of the horſemen, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels, the Captaines of a hundred men of armes: and as for the officers are theſe, the Chauncelour, the Marſhall of the campe, the Threaſurer, the maiſter of the ordnance. Of other chiefes I pretend to ſay nothing, for aſmuch as their office and charge is well known vnto euery man, that it wold be time loſt, to ſpeake of a thing ſo manifeſt and plaine. But to come to the matter. I ſaye that it were not amiſſe, that thoſe two eſtates, to witte, that of the Captaine General of the footmen, and of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Generall of the horſemen, to be exerciſed by two marſhals of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> or others of leſſe qualitie might bee deputed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, ſith it is in the king, to chuſe whome it ſhall bee his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:10495:108"/>
and hee that muſt name them: for it ſufficeth, that they are aduaunced vnto theſe eſtates, and created by his hands: nor we muſt not diſpute whether theſe, of whome I ſpeake heere, are thoſe which in times paſt were called <hi>Magiſtri Militum,</hi> and <hi>Magiſtri equitum,</hi> or <hi>Praefecti Militum,</hi> and <hi>Tribuni:</hi> for it were better for vs to imitate the auncient <hi>Romanes,</hi> in that they did duely exerciſe their charge, then to ſpend time in theſe curious matters.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I will ſpeake of the charge of their offices, which is this: the Captaine Generall of the footmen, ought to haue a regard that his Legions ſhould bée lodged the moſt commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly that they might bée poſſible. He ought alſo to haue a care to keepe his men from mutinies, or if ſo bée that any did happen, to quench the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> immediatly by ſome good meanes. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, it is his charge to iudge controuerſies that come before him to be determined, and to giue ſuch order therein as apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth.</p>
                     <p>Alſo he ought to cauſe the Legions oftentimes to bée raunged in battaile, to view whether they haue their full number, and bée in ſtate to fight: for not doing this, he ſhall thinke himſelfe to bée ſtrong enough to vanquiſh his enemies, when he hath not enow to defend himſelfe againſt them, nor ſkant the one halfe of thoſe bée made his accompt of: becauſe that men doe dye, and demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh by diuers meanes, ſo that the Legions do want their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: inſomuch, that who ſo doth not take heed, ſhall find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe greatly weakened of Souldiers in a ſhort time. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſayd Captaine Generall muſt looke vnto it, as often as he may, cauſing the Colonells to ſhewe their rowles, who muſt giue him reckoning of the number that they doe want in their Legions: and it is his duetie to make reporte vnto the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Generall, for to haue order that the Bandes may be ſpée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delie furniſhed with their full number, if ſo bée that they bée in place where it maie bee doone: or to take counſayle therevpon, for to meaſure his enterpriſes and power, with the force and ſtrength of his enemies: this dooing I doubt not but that his buſines will fall out according vnto his will and deſire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="192" facs="tcp:10495:109"/>I would that thys manner of viſiting the bandes, from time to time, had bene in vſe at that time when as the king helde his ſiege before <hi>Pauy,</hi> for hee had knowen his eſtate better then hee did.</p>
                     <p>The charge of the ſaid Captaine General of the footmen ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth alſo vnto the practiſing of ſouldiours, vnto whome hee ought to bee aſſiſtaunt, as often as the ſaid legions ſhalbe exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed togeather, or one alone. In ſumme, he is appointed to haue a care of all that appertaineth vnto the footmen, to counſaile the Lieuetenaunt Generall of the armie, and to eaſe his burthen aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as poſſibly he may.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the charge of the Captaine Generall of the horſmen, he ought to look into all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paſſeth amongſt the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as the other doth into al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> paſſeth amongſt footmen, aſwel for the neceſſarye lodging of them, as for reuewes, exerciſes mutunies, and other things, and likewiſe that euery horſeman ſhould be furniſhed according vnto his eſtate. Moreouer, aſwell this Captaine Generall as the other, ought to bee expert in the warres, and the one to know howe to exerciſe the others of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, for that it is not ſayde, but that at a neede, they might put their hands vnto both. To be ſhort, theſe two chiefes ſhall ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times viſit the watches round about the camp, &amp; either of them, of himſelfe ſhalbe aſmuch worthe in a daye of battaile, as a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall chiefe might be: not that they ſhould command, or ſhould do any thing of themſelues, but I meane that they ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to doe it, when it were needfull, in abſence of the Lieuete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant general. They ſhal take the watchword of the Lieutenant Generall, and the one of them muſt afterwards giue it vnto his Colonels, and the other vnto his Captaines. As for the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels they muſt giue the watchword vnto their Sergeant Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iors, after that they haue receiued it from the captaine generall of the footmen. The Colonel his charge is to be circumſpect that the captaines or ſouldiers, doe make no falſe muſters, and to haue a regarde of the ſicke and hurte men, to the intent, that they may bee diligently dreſt and cheriſhed. Moreouer, a Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell ought to haue a care of the ſuppreſſing of Mutinies, and to appeaſe Souldiers, when as they are mooued for anye thing,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:10495:109"/>
and ought alſo to haue a regard that the Legion ſhould be well armed, weaponed, and in ſtate to fight, and ſhould be as readie, and practiſed, as might be poſſible: wherein euery Colonell muſt be diligent, and muſt raunge them in battaile himſelfe, to the intent that they ſhould neuer refuſe to do any thing that ſhould be commanded them, how hard or painefull ſo euer it were. And to haue them to be ſo, I ſay that there is no better meane then to accuſtome them betime to abide hardneſſe: and better it were to do it in time when as they haue no néede to do it, then to deferre them vntill ſuch time as they muſt do it, how vnwilling ſo euer they be, and by that meanes they would not be diſcouraged, although they ſhould abide great extremities, for as much as they ſhould be accuſtomed vnto neceſſities and labour.</p>
                     <p>A Colonell ought to haue intelligence of the crimes that thoſe of his Legion doe commit, and to procéede in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon them after the manner that I will ſhew héereafter. Finally, amongſt other things he muſt take héed to ſée good watch kept in his quarter, and to gouerne his Legion in peace &amp; iuſtice. A Captaine of the men of armes hath the like charge ouer his horſſemen that a Colonell hath ouer his footemen: and is charged as well to exerciſe his men, as a Colonell is to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his footemen, and to haue a regard vnto their armes and horſſes that all ſhould be in good order, to wéet, that their armes ſhould be whole &amp; bright, their Horſſes well harneſſed and ſhod to haue ſeruice of them hourely, and that the ſaid Horſſes ſhould be ſeruiceable, ſwift, long breathed, good trauailers, as gentle as may be, or at the leaſt no ſtrikers, for ſuch horſes are dangerous in a preaſe, for that one ſtroake of a Horſſe foote may ſpoile a moſt valiant man. Me thinke I haue ſpoken ynough of theſe foure Chiefes, when as I haue ſaid that they ought to eaſe one anothers burthen, and to keepe their people in good quiet, for as much as theſe two points do comprehend a great number in generall, but ſith I haue ſpoken mine opinion of many other perticularly, me thinke I haue fully ſatiſfied this matter. But yet I will ſay further, the foure aforeſayd Chiefes ought to gouerne their people in ſuch ſorte, that there might no one
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:10495:110"/>
Souldier be found who ſhould be the occaſion of any diſorder: but that all things ſhould be ſo gouerned and moderated, that the Campe might be the harbour of all honeſt men, and their refuge and Sanctuary, within which, all things ought to be as ſafe, as in one of our Churches: and therefore there muſt a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard be had that the Souldyers might liue well within the Campe: and is alſo neceſſary to giue order that they ſhould kéepe their hands from taking other mens goods without the Campe, either néere, or farre off, except it be from their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes, and yet not from them, without leaue of the Generall of the Army, for it is he that muſt permit (before that any thing may be done) that the Souldiers might ſpoile and bring away that they could finde, and vſe it afterwards as their owne. But this rule is not obſerued at this day amongſt our Souldiers, they will not ſtay while the ſpoiling of a towne or countrey be permitted by the Generall, for they will take authoritie of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: and they do not only vſe this liberty againſt their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes, and in a conqueſted countrey, but alſo they handle thoſe that yéeld vpon the brute of their comming, long time before the army do come néere vnto their countrey, as ill as thoſe who haue ſtood obſtinate vntill the comming of the army, and vntill they are declared Rebels and enemies.</p>
                     <p>Yet if we will indifferently conſider of the robberies, raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes, thefts, and violences which they do in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> not farre from their owne dwellings, we ſhall thinke that the hurt that they do after that they are out of <hi>Fraunce</hi> in another countrey, not to be ſtrange: but I leaue that for this time, to take in hand to ſpeake of the charge of foure principall Officers of the army, the one of which is a Ciuilyan, and doth execute the office of Chauncellor properly, for that he is an aſſiſtant vnto the Generall, as often as there is cauſe to ſpeake of the adminiſtration of iuſtice, be it in Ciuill cauſes, or in Criminall, and in caſes of complaint, whether it be one perticular perſon that complaineth, or a whole countrey: and for to aunſwere the demaunds of Ambaſſadors, and the requeſts of a perticular perſon, towne, or countrey: and if any Proclamation ſhould be made, it is he that ought to penne it, ſpecially for that the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:10495:110"/>
knowledge of the lawes of the Emperours which are neceſſary, are not commonly in the heads of the Lieutenants Generals that are now adayes.</p>
                     <p>This ſaid Ciuilyan is to aſſiſt the Generall when he will make any newe orders, concerning any matter of conſequencie, and finally, to make aunſwere vnto Letters that do come from any great perſonage, chiefely, if it be matter of importance: in ſumme, he is called to all counſailes wherein there lieth any difficultie. And moreouer beſides all theſe ſeruices aboueſaid, he may buſie himſelfe to cauſe victuals to be brought into the Campe, and to all other places where any prouiſion ought to be layd, whether it were to victuall the Campe, a Towne, or for a paſſage: and yet this charge is more fit for the Marſhall of the Campe, or for the Prouoſt generall, or for an expreſſe commiſſioner of the victuals, then for a long gowne; yet I haue ſéene the Lord Chauncellor that is at this inſtant execute this office as well within <hi>Fraunce</hi> as without, continuing the warres that we haue had within theſe foure yeares. Before him I neuer knewe any of his qualitie execute that office: but to be a Counſellour vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Generall as is aboueſaid, I do not denie, for I haue ſeene one with <hi>Mounſieur de Lautrec,</hi> who vſed the title and office of Chauncellor. Now to ſpeake of the Marſhall of the Campe, who is one of the principall officers of an hoaſt, vnto whome it apperteineth to place the Campe, and to diſtribute it into quarters, and to fortifie it: he alſo is to regard that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> victuals ſhould be equally diſtributed throughout all the quarters of the Campe, and that euery thing ſhould be ſet in his place. The controuerſies which are not vnder the Colonels, or of thoſe that are not of the Campe, the complaints of victualers, of artificers, and of other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of occupation which do follow a Campe, do come before him: he alſo muſt haue care of the ſick men. The third principall officer is the maiſter of the Ordnance, who is of no ſmall eſtimation at this day, becauſe of the eſtimation that we do make of that inſtrument. His charge is, to cauſe his pieces to be well mounted, and to haue them furniſhed with great quantitie of ſhot and powder.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="196" facs="tcp:10495:111"/>Moreouer, he ought to haue good Gunners, many Pioners, Smithes, Carpenters, Carters, and other people fit for the occupation of the Ordnance. It apperteineth vnto his office to be expert, to make the approches before a place, for to batter it, to haue iudgement of himſelfe, and alſo to be inquiſitiue of them that knowe the place, where it may be beſt approched, and beaten, is weakeſt, and eaſieſt to be taken.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, he ought to haue vnderſtanding in Mines, to deuiſe them, and to cauſe them to be made as they ought to be: which being made with iudgement, may do them great ſeruice that do beſiege a ſtrong place, and hardly will they be preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The Countie <hi>Pedro</hi> of <hi>Nauarre</hi> had the beſt ſkill in theſe Mines of any man in his time and ours: and by the meanes of them hath taken many Townes and Caſtles, as well againſt the King, as for him.</p>
                     <p>We may ſay that the Lord of <hi>Bury</hi> hath ſuccéeded in the ſaid Countie his place, for he in mine opinion doth vnderſtand this buſineſſe as well as any man in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> or if I durſt ſay, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: I ſhould not greatly faile if I ſaid better then any other nation. Concerning the Ordnance, it ought to be accoumpted amongſt the moſt excellenteſt armes, as in the vſe of it we do ſee the effect, but leaue that to it ſelfe which doth ſufficiently commend it ſelfe: I do ſay, that he that doth exerciſe the office of the Maiſter of the Ordnance, muſt haue an eye vnto all thoſe that do belong vnto it, and to puniſh thoſe that do offend.</p>
                     <p>It had bin neceſſary that I had followed my Lord great Eſquyer, who is at this preſent to ſpeake further in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: for euery man knoweth that he doth vnderſtand this occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation better then any other man, but I haue neither had ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to follow him, nor time to learne after other, wherefore I will content my ſelfe with theſe Generalities which I haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of, without paſſing further. Now it is neceſſary to ſpeake of the Threaſurer, who is one of the neceſſaryeſt Officers in a Campe, becauſe of the charge that he hath vnder hys hands, to wéete, the King his money, which is the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the warres, without which, it is impoſſible that an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my could be mainteined long, hauing to do with a ſtrong,

and obſtinate enemy. The ſaid Threaſorer is to imploy the Kings money many wayes for the preferment of his ſeruice, moreouer, he ought to receiue the tributes, and taxes that the townes and countrey conqueſted do pay vnto the King, and that thoſe that are vnder his obedience do contribute: or if ſo be that there be any league, and that the ſaid league ſhould furniſh money and no people: he muſt alſo prouide that the Campe ſhould be furniſhed with ſtore of victuall, and muſt haue a care that euery man as well the great as the ſmall, the Pyoners, as the principals, ſhould be contented and paid their wages at the tearme that they ought to be paid, if you would that the King ſhould be well ſerued, and that the ſouldiers ſhould obey theyr Chiefes, and be men of good life. For if money do want, I do not knowe how a Camp could be mainteined, nor the ſouldiers kept from robbing, and committing of a thouſand miſchiefes: for I ſee no meanes how to correct them for any fault, when as neceſſitie doth conſtraine them therevnto: but I do not ſay but that they ought to haue patience, and to haue a care not to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, although that money be long a comming: for I do knowe well ynough that it cannot alwayes be brought at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, becauſe of the lets that they haue oft times that ſhould bring it, or that the threaſurie is ſometimes ſo neere emptyed, that there muſt be a time to recouer newe: and therefore the ſouldiers ought to haue patience vntill it be leuyed, and do ariue: but if the attending for it be too long, there is nothing more iniuſt then to haue men to liue by the winde, or without money, like vnto gray Friers. But then there muſt be daily a certaine quantitie of victuals diſtributed vnto them, and other things neceſſary for their liuing, and apparell to mainteine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vntill that their pay do come: or for to abandon them to their owne diſcretions (that is to ſay, that they may take where they can finde it) which is a thing that ought neuer to be permitted but in an extremity, and when as all other meanes do faile, for that this liberty is cauſe that the ſouldiers do fall into ſuch inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, that it will be almoſt impoſſible to bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> afterwards againe into their right courſe: yet it is leſſe dangerous then to ſee them to periſh with famine, and to ſee the army to decay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our faces. The one of which two will happen if ſo be that
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:10495:112"/>
it be not foreſéene ſpéedely, and the fault héereof muſt not be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed vnto Chiefes or Captaines, when as we do know that they cannot haue wherewithall to nouriſh themſelues &amp; others, ſeeing that their wages is behind as well as the ſouldiers, and are as néedy, or more néedy, then the ſimpleſt ſouldier. If we wil ſay that the ſpeaches of the Chiefes do appeaſe, &amp; prolong the ſouldiers, I do confeſſe it to be true: but it is but for a few daies, &amp; whileſt the ſouldiers do giue ſome credit vnto their words: but afterwards when they do ſée that they are led fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> day to day with bare words, there will be no meane to keepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> contented any longer, but they will murmur after diuers manners, &amp; will giue no more credit vnto their Chiefs afterwards: it might alſo be an occaſion that they would not credit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at other times whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they do tell them the truth, and when as it ſhall be verie ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to vſe ſpeaches vnto them: for one of the principalleſt point y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a Chiefe ought to haue in recommendatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is, not to lye vnto his ſouldiers, if that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vntruth may be found &amp; diſcouered afterwards, becauſe that at another time he ſhall haue much to do to perſwade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to belieue him in ſpeaking the truth, for that he hath deceiued them before. And although that there ought a regard to be had in this matter, yet at this day we would that lyes ſhould ſtand in ſtead of paiment, &amp; that ſouldiers ſhould be pacified with words, &amp; by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meanes the Captaine is diſcredited for a thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> may be remedied another way, &amp; when all is ſaid, to couer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Threaſurers faults by another man, who oft times do play the Dukes in good townes, whilſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſouldiers do ſterue in a Camp, or do imploy the money that is due vnto ſouldiers, to their perticular vſes, whereas they ought to leaue all other buſines vndone to be at the Campe in due time. The Threaſurer for the warres ought to prouide in ſuch ſort, that the ſouldiers, &amp; all others that do take wages, might be paid at their tearme: and if ſo be that the paiment do ſtay certain daies after that tearme, that at the leaſt the ſouldiers do not looſe thoſe daies, for reaſon would that the workeman ſhould be paide his hyre. And when as the ſaid Threaſurer doth know that it will be longer before money do come then were néedefull it ſhould be, he muſt aduertiſe the Lieutenant Generall incontinent, that order may be taken how euery man ſhould liue: and that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:10495:112"/>
of victuals might be made before hand, to be diſtributed afterwards vnto euery man according vnto his eſtate, to attend whilſt that money doth come. And there would be no great hurt done if that the ſouldiers did knowe how long it would be ere that they ſhould be paide, for ſome would ſaue their money and haue to ſpare that make no reckening to ſpare, thinking to receiue newe money at the ende of the moneth, ſuch as do liue but from hand to mouth, without care what ſhall come after. By meanes of this aduertiſement, the Captaines ſhould not néede to content their people with words, &amp; the ſouldiers ſhould haue as little occaſion to miſtruſt their Chiefes. And this is all that I do pretend to ſpeake of the foure Officers or Magiſtrats aforeſaid, who are to haue to do with many other things, but theſe that I haue ſpoken of are the moſt generall. I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore returne to my matter which I left before, concerning the placing and ordering of a Campe: for diuiſion whereof, it were neceſſary that thoſe that ſhould haue that charge, ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in the art of meaſuring, to the intent that immediatly after that the place is choſen, they may giue the Campe ſuch ſquare forme as is ſaid, and afterwards diſtribute the quarters, places, &amp; publike ſtreates, &amp; in ſumme, all that is requiſite in a Campe, which doing, they ſhall neuer be conſtrained to ſtay long for the ordering of a Campe, for that they muſt keepe alwayes one ſelfe-ſame forme, and manner of lodging, without varietie at any time: and by that meanes euery man ſhould knowe hys place after once lodging, although that no bodie do ſhewe him his quarter, becauſe that of himſelfe he ſhall eaſily vnderſtand what ſpace, and how much place euery man ought to occupy in his quarter, which may not be vnderſtood and obſerued by thoſe that do ſeeke to lodge their Camps in ſtrong places, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are conſtrained to alter the formes of their Camps, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto the varietie of the ſcituation, wherevnto the <hi>Romans</hi> would in no caſe be ſubiect, for as I haue ſaid before, they did alwaies fortifie by their arte the ſcituations which were weake of themſelues, as we may do if we will, and vſe it in the ſame ſort that they did, or in better: for we haue Ordnance which they had not, albeit that they had certayne other engins,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:10495:113"/>
which neuer haue béen put in vſe ſince the ſayd Ordnance hath béen inuented: neither were they of that violence that it is, nor ſo eaſy to be carryed too and fro. For the reſt, it is knowne that the greateſt part of theyr fortreſſes were made of wood, which might not endure againſt one ſhot of thoſe pieces that we do vſe to beate places withall at this inſtant: againſt which there is no other remedie, but to make rampars of earth, and of the greateſt thicknes that is poſſible, which yet can very hardly withſtand them: and were it not that it doth yéeld vnto the ſhot, and by that meanes doth kill it, a man ſhould make but ſorie worke in ramparing with earth, or with other matter, for it would be time loſt, I do meane for the ſtrengthning of a Towne, but not of a Campe: for that Camps do thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be as ſtrong in the field as their enemyes are, and conſequently will not ſuffer themſelues to be beſieged &amp; beaten with Ordnance, ſo that they néede not to make any ſuch great rampars as I ſpeake of, except that they be very weake, and feare to be forced to fight, or do forbeare attending ſuccour: for in theſe caſes they muſt ſéeke by all meanes to fortifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and to haue all the aduantages that might be thought vpon: as to make plat-formes of earth, and caualiers rayſed high to beate round about the Campe a farre off. The Lord <hi>Conſtables</hi> Campe that was before <hi>Auignon,</hi> was of the moſt incomparable force of all other that euer I haue ſéene in my time for a camp ſcituated in plaine ground. By this appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that we haue the meanes &amp; induſtry to fortifie a Camp as well as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> auncient <hi>Romanes</hi> had, if we do conſider of the little force of their engins, &amp; of the marueilous violence of ours. And furthermore, that our rampars being of earth, we néede not to build towres or caſtles of wood, to the intent to be the ſurer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the violence of the Cannon, which breaketh &amp; ſhiuereth to pieces all that it doth meet withall: wherefore we muſt not thinke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it would be hard for vs to keepe alwaies one forme of camp if we would: but alſo we muſt belieue that it is as eaſy for vs to do it, as it was for the ſaid <hi>Romanes,</hi> and eaſier, becauſe wood is hard to be found, but there is earth ynough to be had euery where.</p>

                        <pb n="201" facs="tcp:10495:113"/>In this paſſage I muſt ſpeake ſomewhat of the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that a Lieutenant Generall ought to haue when he will incampe néere vnto his enemies: before that he enterpriſe to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach ſo néere vnto his enemies, that the two armies cannot afterwards depart the one from the other without ſhame or bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile. He ought to haue conſideration of his eſtate and force, to knowe whether his men haue a good will to fight or not, or if they are ſtrong enough to doe it whenſoeuer his enemies ſhould aſſault him, or elſe I would not bee of opinion that he ſhould put himſelfe into that daunger: foraſmuch as it would be to be doubted that his enemies would aſſayle him, at ſuch time as he would thinke to lodge, and before that his Campe could be fortified. Suppoſe that he were not fought withall at that inſtant, I cannot thinke but that the ſayd enemie atttendant would famiſh him, or elſe the ſcituation of the countrie muſt bée very fauourable. For to auoyd theſe incoueniences, the aforeſaid Generall ought to looke vnto his buſines: and if ſo be that he bée ſtrong enough to deale with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there is no daunger if he do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach them within Cannon ſhot: hauing viewed himſelfe the place whereas he will plant his Camp, or cauſed it to be viewed before that his Legions do ariue. And the Legions being ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, he muſt cauſe the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> to keepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in order of battaile, with their faces towards their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and muſt helpe himſelfe with the <hi>Triaries</hi> to make his trenches vpon the flankes, when as he is not ſufficiently furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with Pioners: and to incloſe the other ſides, he might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the ſeruants and boyes with other followers of the armie: all which ſhould labour at the backe of the battaile being coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> and <hi>Princes.</hi> The Forlorne hope ſhould be in their order of battaile, and the horſemen likewiſe. If the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie would fight in the meane time, the <hi>Triaries</hi> ſhould alwaies haue time enough to leaue their worke and to take their armes, and to raunge themſelues in their order whileſt that the <hi>Haſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> do make reſiſtance, &amp; ſo his battailes ſhould by no meanes bee ſurpriſed. But let vs ſuppoſe that his enemie do make no great ſhewe to aſſayle him raunged in battaile, but doth giue him ſkirmiſhes all day long to trouble his people, and to keepe
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:10495:114"/>
them in armes to hinder the fortification of his Campe: this bragge muſt be no cauſe of ſtay, but they muſt do the like by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and giue them good ſtore of great ſhot withall, cauſing the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaries</hi> and others, as I haue ſayd, to keepe themſelues conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in battaile, and the <hi>Triaries</hi> to continue at their worke, not ſtirring from it vntill ſuch time as the Campe were fortified and the quarters made. This done, the ſayd <hi>Triaries</hi> muſt bee firſt lodged and the prouiſion immediatly. And after them the <hi>Princes</hi> and the Ordnance which muſt be brought into the place where it is accuſtomed to be placed. The <hi>Haſtaries</hi> muſt after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards take their places, and afterwards the horſemen: to wéet, the men of armes firſt, the light horſemen after them, and the Hargoletiers and Harquebuziers on horſebacke after them, and laſt of all the Forlorne hope: ſo that thoſe that ought to bee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt when they ſhould enter into battaile againſt their enemies, ſhall bee the laſt that ſhall bee lodged: and in lodging them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner, there might be no diſorder nor cryings as there is amongſt vs. For when our Souldiers are to bee lodged in Campe, euery man runneth to bee the firſt lodged, crying and making ſuch a noyſe that it is a confuſion, ofttimes lodging the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues before their turnes, making no accompt to leaue their Enſignes and to abandon them, hauing their enemies in their teeth.</p>
                     <p>The Lord Marſhall of <hi>Montian</hi> was in great diſtreſſe through this diſorder, with his Auantgard before <hi>Montcailer:</hi> for that euen at that inſtant that wee looked that the <hi>Spanyards</hi> ſhould haue aſſayled vs, our Enſignes were left from time to time without people, who were gone to ſeeke lodgings: albeit that they had no leaue of him nor their Captaines, and in lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelues, God knowes what a noyſe thoſe gapers and cryers did make: and what was the cauſe of this diſorder, but the diſobedience that is amongſt vs <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> who are ſo delicate that we cannot ſuffer want one whole day, but wee waſt with griefe of it as ſnowe againſt the Sunne. Certainly the ſayd Lord did his endeuour to ſtay them, and it was needfull for the daunger that we were in: and at that time was ſeen (aſmuch as in any other place) the great want of order that is amongſt
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:10495:114"/>
vs: ſpecially in the morning in paſſing a little brooke, for except it were ſome of the firſt rankes of the Battailon, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> others made no difficultie at all to breake, and put themſelues out of their ranks, to paſſe at their caſe one after an other ouer a little planke that was in the ſame place: ſo that it was our good fortune that we were not aſſayled at that inſtant: for the firſt ſhould haue ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the ſmart of the others negligence and diſorder: and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps there might haue inſued ſome great inconuenience, as it was told me within two daies after when as I did ariue at the Campe, for at that time I was not there, becauſe of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion that the Lord Conſtable had giuen vnto the Lord of <hi>Roberual,</hi> and the commaundement that he gaue me by his letter to accompanie the ſayd <hi>Roberual</hi> with my hand, to ceaze vpon the vallies of S. <hi>Martin</hi> and <hi>Lucerne</hi> to the King his vſe, and by that meanes I was not there: notwithſtanding, I was told of it afterwards of all that happened in the Campe by men of credite, who were in the daunger afore ſayd very néere vnto the perſon of the ſayd Lord: to weet, the Barron <hi>Caſtelnan,</hi> and the Vicont <hi>Dorth,</hi> and ſince much better by the Lord <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres,</hi> who told me all: &amp; helped to repayre &amp; couer the diſorder, as others haue tolde me. Thoſe cryings muſt not bee vſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt theſe Legions of whom I treate: they muſt be alwaies lodged timely before night, if it were poſſible. Which doing, vſing the manner that I haue ſo many times ſpoken of before, that is, the Campe hauing alwaies one ſelfe-ſame forme: it ſhall not bee needfull for the Souldiers to ſeeke their quarters, or where the bands ſhould lodge, for they ſhall know y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> places of themſelues, for they ſhall ſee where their Enſignes do ſtay, and by them know their places eaſely, and the Enſignes ſhall know their places as eaſely by the General his lodging, and the gates which ſhall be towards the foure Regions, as I haue ſayd. All that may make any alteration in a Campe, is, that the firſt and ſecond Legions ſhall be alwaies lodged next their enemies, and thereunto the Souldiers muſt haue a regard euery man vnto the place that he ſhall lodge in. Further, it muſt not be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to appoynt certaine bands to watch: for that without watch, the fortification of the Campe, and all that may be ſayd or done
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:10495:115"/>
for theſe Legions would bee labour loſt. But ſith I am fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into this matter, I will ſpeake mine opinion of the Skoutes and Sentenells that are placed by night without a Campe, which is a cuſtome that I cannot iudge to be either good or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceable: neither can I finde vppon what example they were grounded that were the firſt inuenters of this manner: for it is not after the manner of the auncient watches, at the leaſt thoſe that I haue read of, I do thinke that they had a more care to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyd the miſchief that might happen through the renewing and chaunging of the Skoutes and Sentenells: for that they might perhappes be ſometimes corrupted with monie, or bee ſurpriſed ſo neere, that the watch might not bee aduertiſed by them of the comming of their enemies: ſpecially if it were ſo that the watch were kept after the <hi>French</hi> faſhion, that is to ſay, if the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers did ſleepe their bellies full, in hope to bee wakened by the Sentenells, it ſhould be in daunger to bee ſurpriſed and to haue their throtes cut. For which cauſe the auncient men of warre made their watches within their trenches, and had no bodie to ſkout without: and by this manner of watch they were alwaies ſo well preſerued, that they altered it not, but vſed very great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in it, and very good order, and puniſhed all thoſe with death that fayled of their dueties in the ſame, as wee may ſee in <hi>Polibius:</hi> vnto whom I ſend all thoſe that would ſee the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their doing at large. Me thinke that the reaſons aboue ſayd may ſuffice to ſhewe the profite of ſending of Skoutes out of a fort: which is, that they do ſerue for no other purpoſe but to make the watch within to bee the more careleſſe and negligent: for they do giue themſelues vnto nothing but to play, dronken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſleepe (as I haue ſayd) whileſt peraduenture the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenells do keepe as ill watch as they. But is not this a great fault to commit the ſafetie of a whole armie vnto two or three royſters, who haue neither regarde of honeſtie nor any other thing: and albeit that thoſe that are Skoutes on horſebacke, are gentlemen, and men of credit: and likewiſe thoſe that viſite the watch do their indeuour aſmuch as is poſſible, may not both ſometimes be ſurpriſed by their enemies, or may they not ſleepe aſwell as the others, and forget their buſines, &amp; by that meanes
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:10495:115"/>
be ſlaine by their enemies: but may it not happen that their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies might haue the watch word, or that they might geſſe at it, and approach the Sentenells with falſe tokens giuen them to vnderſtand that they are of their Souldiers: I knowe not who hath ſhewed vs this manner, nor what reaſon wee haue to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue it at this day, men of warre being more ſubtile and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke then they were in times paſt, except we will be voyd of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to perſiſt in a moſt euident and manifeſt error, whereunto I wil not from henceforth, that a Lieutenant Generall ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but that he ſhould forbid it expreſſely. And furthermore, that for his ordinarie night-watch he do appoynt the one third part of his people, which are <hi>16.</hi> Enſignes of footmen, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that the Souldiers might haue two nights free: the one of which Enſignes muſt watch round about the General his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and another muſt guard the Powder: two other Enſignes muſt bee placed vpon the two market places: for the maiſter of Ordnance his quarter is well enough furniſhed with gunners, carters and pioners. By this accompt there ſhould bee in the middeſt of the Camp one band of euery Legion, who ſhal guard the Generall and principall Chiefes, and alſo impeach the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes which oftimes do happen by night, and the exceſſes and thefts that are done more at time then by day. The <hi>12.</hi> bands which do remaine, three of euery Legion ſhall keepe watch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longſt the rampars in the emptie ſpace that I haue left betwixt the rampar and the quarter: I do meane that three bands of the firſt Legion ſhall keepe watch againſt the quarter of the fourth Legion; and thoſe of the fourth againſt the quarter of the firſt; thoſe of the ſecond Legion ſhall keepe watch againſt the quarter of the third; and thoſe of the third againſt the quarter of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond: ſo that by this meanes the Souldiers ſhould haue the leſſe oportunitie to ſteale from their watch vnto their lodgings, which they would doe perhaps if their watch were néere their quarter.</p>
                     <p>The greateſt ſtrength of the watch muſt be at the gates, and at the fower corners of the Camp: and in ſtead of the Skoutes which we do ſend out to be the better aduertiſed of our enemies comming, the fourth part of the ſayd watch muſt bee kept wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:10495:116"/>
and ſo by that meanes the watch ſhall be deuided into fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer watches: and to proceede in this watch the more equally, ſo that the one watch might not bee more grieued or burdened then the other, the Generall his Trumpet ſhall ſignifie by his ſound, at what time they ought to be chaunged, and for to do it iuſtly, he ought to haue ſome ſure clocke, or the Marſhall of the Campe ſhould giue him the aduertiſement. This charge might be giuen vnto one of the foure Colonells, who ought to watch euery man in his turne, euery night one: and each of them in his turne ſhould haue the whole charge of the watch throughout the Campe. As for the horſemen, their office ſhall bee to ſearch the watch, and ſhould bee deuided into fiue night watches, that is, two <hi>Decuries</hi> of euery companie of men of armes, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of other horſemen after that rate. And if this number be thought to be too great (for it doth amount vnto <hi>480.</hi> horſe for euery night) there might bee but the one halfe of them appoynted, or any other number that might bee thought ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and they might bee deuided into two watches, or more. <hi>Vegetius</hi> would that the horſemen ſhould keepe Sentenell without the Campe by night: but he doth alleadge no reaſon for it, which is the occaſion that I do not ground my ſelfe any way vpon his ſaying, ſith I haue very good reaſons on my ſide, and that I do preſuppoſe that the Camp is a very ſtrong place: but if it were in an open place, and without rampar, I do not ſay that I would not put horſemen out vpon the waies. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the watch by day, they muſt do it that watched by night, or a great part of them. And then I would keepe horſemen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad round about the Campe to ſee who goeth and commeth, and in ſo doing, the Campe need not to feare ſurpriſe. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the giuing of the watch word, and the renewing of it euery euening, and ſometimes to chaunge it foure or fiue times in one night, I will ſay nothing, nor of many other ſmall poyntes that we are accuſtomed in this matter: for they are well enough knowne vnto euery man. Of one thing I do meane to ſpeake, which may do them ſome pleaſure that do make accompt of it, and contrariwiſe may do them ſome great miſchiefe that do not regard it: that is, diligently to looke into all thoſe that come into
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:10495:116"/>
the Campe, and thoſe that go out: and likewiſe vnto thoſe that do want by night, and vnto newe commers: for this is a thing of great importance, and may be eaſely done, by the meanes of the diuiſions of the quarters and lodgings, for that it is not onely knowne what number of people ſhould lodge in euery quarter, but in euery tent perticularly, by which meanes it may be eaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie found if any do want, or if there were any newe commers. Thoſe that do want, or do lodge out of their quarter, ſhall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed as fugitiues, except that they had leaue of their ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours: and thoſe that ſhould bee found ouer and aboue the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſhould be demaunded what buſines they had there, &amp; ſhould bee conſtrained to giue an accompt of their qualitie throughly. This induſtrie will bee an occaſion that our enemies could not practiſe, or haue conference with our Souldiers, how ſecretly ſoeuer they ſhould go to worke. And moreouer, there would this commoditie proceed of it, that is, our enemies ſhould ſeldome knowe any ſure newes of our eſtate, ſo that this obſeruation might haue place, which is a great poynt: and hereof the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> made a very great accompt, as wee do finde written in many places expreſly by that, which <hi>Claudius Nero</hi> did once in his Campe, being lodged néere vnto <hi>Anniball</hi> in <hi>Calabria,</hi> who departed ſo ſecretly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his Campe to ioyne with <hi>Salina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> who was at <hi>Anconne</hi> againſt <hi>Aſdruball,</hi> that he went vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his companion and helped to ouerthrowe <hi>Aſdruball,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with his people backe agayne into his Campe, <hi>Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball</hi> not vnderſtanding of his going or comming. Hardly could this be done at this preſent in a <hi>French</hi> Campe, for that all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of perſons are ſuffered there, and becauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thoſe are not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed that go out without leaue, what commaundement ſoeuer is giuen that they ſhould not abandon their Enſignes: and wée may make what cryes we wil either of this, or other things, ſith there is no regard had to cauſe them to bee ſtraightly obſerued, nor to puniſh thoſe that do contrarie vnto the cryes: &amp; yet there is nothing in this world that we ought to keepe ſo much in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience as an hoaſt. And therefore Militarie lawes ought to bee moſt ſharpe, and hee that hath the charge of Iuſtice to bee moſt rigorous. Of this matter there ſhall hereafter bee ſpoken in his
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:10495:117"/>
courſe. To make an ende, I ſay that in the olde time when as they would raiſe their Camps, the Captaine Generall his Trompet ſounded three times. At the firſt ſound they tooke downe their Tents, and made their packes: at the ſecond they did lade: and at the third euery man went into the field, and martched towards the place that the Generall did appoynt them. In our time the firſt ſound commaundeth to ſaddle, and ſerueth in ſtead of their firſt. Our ſecond commaundeth to put foote in the ſtirrupe, and ſo was theirs. It would not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe that wee did keepe amongſt vs the ſilence that the <hi>Turkes</hi> do vſe in their departing from their lodgings, who do diſlodge ſo quietly, that it is almoſt impoſſible to perceiue it by the little noyſe that they do make: and their ſilence likewiſe in lodging is ſuch, that a man might thinke them rather to be dumme, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe: whereas we do farre differ from them, that whether it be in lodging, or whileſt wee do abide in the Campe, or in our departing, wee could not well heare if God ſhould thunder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs. A Lieutenant Generall ought yet to haue diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſiderations in the placing of the Campe: principally two; the one is to lodge in a healthfull place; &amp; the other, that his enemies may not beſiege it, nor cut it off from victualls, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. He ought neuer to lodge in a mariſh ground, or in a place of ill ayre, for the auoyding of diſeaſes: which is eaſely knowne by the ſcituation of the place, and the euill colour of the inhabitants that dwell there. As for the other poynt to be free from ſiege, he muſt conſider of the nature of the place, and how he may keepe the way open towards his friends, and where his enemies do keepe and may annoy him: and therevpon to make his coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whether he may be beſieged, or recouer victualls and other things neceſſarie in deſpite of his ſayd enemies. An armie may be beſieged and ouerthrowne without ſtriking ſtroke, if it bee lodged where an enemie may drowne it, by breaking of Sluſes, and fludgates: as happened vnto the Chriſtians in the yeare <hi>1221.</hi> being alongſt the <hi>Nile</hi> nere vnto <hi>Caire</hi> againſt the <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan:</hi> this matter muſt be looked vnto. And certainely, a Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant General ought to haue great knowledge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> countries he muſt paſſe through, and to haue thoſe about them that do know
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:10495:117"/>
them. The ſickneſſe and famine that ofttimes do happen vnto an armie, may bee auoyded by taking heed vnto the exceſſe that the Souldiers do vſe, and to keepe them the better in health, there muſt bee prouiſion made that they may lye in tents, and a care had to lodge them in places where there are good ſtore of trees to ſhadowe them from the Sunne and wether, and for to boyle their meate. It is alſo neceſſarie to take heed that they doe not trauaile in hot wether: and therefore in Summer they muſt depart from their lodgings before day, and be lodged againe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the great heate of day: and in winter they muſt neuer bee made to martch through ſnowe and yce, except they may finde vpon the way wherewithall to make fire. Moreouer, they muſt not be ſuffered to drinke ill waters, nor to be ill clad: for all theſe do cauſe great ſickneſſes, and they muſt be all carefully prouided for, of how baſe condition ſoeuer they bee: and this care doth binde the hearts of Souldiers more vnto their Generall, then any other benefite he can beſtowe vpon them. And in ſo doing it ſhall be for his owne profite: for if that he ſhould haue warres with ſicknes, and likewiſe with his enemies, he might quickly be ouerthrowne, in reſiſting two ſuch aduerſaries. Exerciſe hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth much to keepe mens bodies in health: wherefore the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall muſt cauſe all the Souldiers of his hoaſt to exerciſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in armes once a day at the leaſt, vntill that they do ſweat, if not longer: for there is no better meane to keepe an armie in health, and to make it victorious ouer their enemies, then this.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the famine that may happen vnto a Campe, it is not ſayd that a Generall ought to take heed but of his enemies only, that they ſhould not cut off his victualls: but furthermore he muſt foreſee from whence it might be brought vnto him, and to giue order that the victualls which he hath, do not too haſtely conſume, except he know incontinent where to haue others. And for to do well, he ought alwaies to haue one moneths victualls in ſtore for his whole armie. Suppoſe that he hath in his Camp of men of warre, and all other maner of people <hi>40000.</hi> perſons, and more: <hi>35 Muys</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> meaſure will ſuffice them a whole day honeſtly: out of euery one of which, as ſayth maiſter <hi>Bude,</hi> will bee made <hi>1152.</hi> loafes, euery one of which loafes will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:10495:118"/>
one man a whole day. By this accompt the prouiſion for <hi>30.</hi> daies doth amount vnto <hi>1656.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Concerning horſe meate, Oates and Barley is good: but if that theſe cannot be had, there would be no great daunger if that they liued ſometime without them, prouided that they did not want other foode, if it were poſſible, that is, hey, chaffe, or graſſe: yet graſſe doth weaken them greatly. The leaues and ſmall boughes of trees are good for them, when as there is no better to be had, and the ſtaulkes of vines: and for that they are hard, they may bee broken with mallets, and ſo the horſes may eate them the better. But to come againe to my matter, I ſay that a Lieutenant Generall ought to taxe the townes in the countrie where he makes his warres, or his aliance, if that they bee néere, to bring a certaine great quantitie of victualls vnto his Campe to feed his Souldiers, if that monie do want, or to cauſe them to ſell it at a reaſonable price, both to refreſh his prouiſion, and to keepe it for a need: for as all things that concerne the warres, may be trayned long: ſo alſo famine without helpe, will bring a Campe lowe, and ouerthrowe it in time: and an enemie if he can haue meanes to ouerthrowe it by famine, will neuer prooue to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowe it by battaile; becauſe that the victorie would bée ſo much the leſſe bloudie and daungerous, although it bee not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſo honorable. That which is ſayd may ſuffice to auoyde this incouenience: and Iuſtice, if it be obſerued, will do ſeruice in an hoaſt: and the order which may bee giuen to bridle Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers from liuing after their owne willes, is likewiſe as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie as any other that can be named. And to proue this to be true, concerning the one, all men do knowe that if Iuſtice do not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne in an armie, all things will go quite contrarie, and there is no victualler or other that will bring any thing vnto it. And as concerning the other, if there were no order, a moneths vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall would not laſt one day: wherfore Iuſtice ought to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, &amp; whoſoeuer ſhould vſe force againſt a victualler, ought to be grieuouſly puniſhed. Therefore euery Souldier muſt haue daylie giuen vnto him ſome ſuch quantitie of victuals as he may ſpend in a day: &amp; moreouer, they muſt be forbidden to eate but at certaine houres. This would bee an occaſion that the victualls
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:10495:118"/>
would bée the better ſpared: and that thoſe that do liue this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, will bee much more peaceable, watching, and healthfull, then if they ſhould eate &amp; drinke at all houres, as we don, which cauſeth many perticular quarrells, and the braue muti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ies that wee ſee do raigne amongſt vs. Furthermore, if wee had more people to lodge, then the number aboue ſayd: I ſay that they may be lodged in the places in the middeſt of the Campe, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longſt the ſtreates, or with the Legionaries themſelues: for they are lodged at large. But me thinke that theſe foure Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions with their horſemen, Chiefes, officers, and others, which I haue appoynted to followe the hoaſt, are ſufficient to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe any act of what importance ſoeuer it were, for to fight with twice as many enemies as themſelues. The beſt is, euery man may vſe his owne free wil, and make his warres with as great a number of people as he will himſelfe. Wherefore if the number were much greater, the Campe muſt bee of greater compaſſe then that here before ſpoken of, and notwithſtanding it muſt be diſtributed like vnto it. If it were not that this ſecond part would be greater then the firſt; and the third part too little in reſpect of them, I would proceed further: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will breathe and reſt my ſelfe here, to treate the better of the third Booke.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this third booke ſhall bee ſhewed what meanes a Lieutenant Generall may vſe to bring his warrs to an end in ſhort time. Suppoſe that after he hath ouerthrown his enemies in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile (as is aforeſayd) that there doth yet remaine a certaine number in the field, or that there are certain townes who do ſtand vpon their guard like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, or others which are not to bee truſted: the meanes how to haue an end of the one, &amp; to bee aſſured of the other, are theſe. Firſt of all, if there were any part of the countrie to be ſuſpected to reuolt, if ſo be that it ſhould be left in it intier: the Lieutenant General muſt excogitat ſome practiſe that may be for his profit, and domageable vnto thoſe whome he doth ſuſpect: as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund them to beate downe the walles of their townes, and to baniſh certaine of their citizens: (I meane thoſe whom he doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth moſt) and this commaundement muſt be giuen in ſuch ſort, that no towne ſo commaunded might thinke this charge to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne others then themſelues perticularly: and therefore the ſaid commaundement &amp; charge muſt be giuen in all the ſaid townes at one inſtant, to the intent they might immediatly obey, &amp; not haue reſpit to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferre &amp; take counſaile one of another. And as for the baniſhment of thoſe whom he thinketh might make any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion or rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in a towne, they muſt be deceiued in ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as to bee made to beléeue they ſhall bee imployed in ſome
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:10495:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>
buſines, wherein the Lieutenant will do them good, in giuing them commiſſion to do certaine affayres farre of, in ſome ſuch place where they ſhould haue no meanes to trouble him: which commiſſion might ſtand in ſtead of an honeſt and couered ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. And as for thoſe townes that are of great power, and ſo inclined to diſobey, that for euery litle occaſion they might refuſe the commaundement of the Generall, there is no better meanes then to aſſure himſelf of them, aſſaying to ſurpriſe them at vnwares. And to colour his pretence, he muſt make a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto them of ſome enterpriſe like a trueth: for the execution whereof he is to vſe their helpes, and muſt make ſhewe that he repoſeth great truſt in them, and that his intent is to ſome other purpoſe then to deceiue them. And in mine opinion, they will be perſwaded without any great difficultie: and being once entred into this opinion, they will giue any ſuch nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of their townes men as he will require. And if the Generall do but ſometimes ſmile a little vpon ſome of the principalls, they will bee forward enough to leuie the greateſt part of their people to do him ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice: of whom he may make his profite afterwards, as if they were giuen him for pledges. Furthermore, to bee aſſured of a towne, of whoſe loyaltie there is no good opinion to be had, the remedie that I ſee, whether it bee before the battaile, or after, is to imitate <hi>Pompei</hi> and others, which heretofore haue had the like buſines: for <hi>Pompei</hi> hauing ſome doubt of a towne which is in <hi>Spayne,</hi> prayed the inhabitants that they would lodge the ſicke men of his armie in their towne: which requeſt being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, he ſent them vnder colour of ſicke men, part of the moſt valianteſt Souldiers that he had: who when they were entred, made themſelues maiſters of the ſayd towne incontinent, and ſo conſtrayned them to continue in his aliance. <hi>Publius Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> in like caſe to aſſure himſelfe of the <hi>Epidaures,</hi> cauſed (as we would ſay) a generall pardon to be brought from the Pope into a Church without the towne, and at the day appoynted for them to obtaine the ſayd pardon, all the people went out of the towne, and left but fewe in it to defend it, but the ſayd <hi>Publius</hi> and his men: who ſeeing themſelues to be ſtrongeſt, did ſhut the gates, and would not ſuffer afterwards any man to enter, but thoſe of whom they were well aſſured. Some ſay that he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:10495:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>
all the chiefeſt men to bee giuen for pledges, before he would ſuffer any of the inhabitants to enter. <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, when he made his voyadge into <hi>Aſia,</hi> foreſeeing that the people which he left behind him ſhould not rebell after his departure, (ſpecially the <hi>Thracians</hi> whom he had newly ſubdued) tooke all the principal of the countrie, and the flower of the fighting men, and gaue them many honorable offices in his armie, and all the places of credite, and carried them in his companie: in whoſe places at home he eſtabliſhed ouer the people of <hi>Thrace</hi> certaine men of ſmall qualitie: in which doing, he contented firſt of all the Princes of the countrie by vſing them well, as I haue ſayd: afterwards he vnfurniſhed the countrie of the beſt Souldiers they had, giuing them to vnderſtand that he would be ſerued by them in his enterpriſe (although that that was not only the end of his intent) and moreouer he tooke from the common people all their hope of rebelling, by taking from them all their good Chiefes and good Souldiers. We ſee then by theſe policies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what manner a Generall may aſſure himſelfe of thoſe whom he doth ſuſpect. As for the taking of the townes which holde ſtrong of themſelues, or which haue garriſon of enemies, is a matter that ſhall be ſpoken of hereafter. At this preſent I will continue theſe matters of policie and foreſight: for they may ſtand our Generall in ſome ſtead in time and place. If ſo bee he ſhould haue any ſuſpition in any of his counſaile, to weete, that he did diſcouer his ſecrets and his eſtate vnto his enemies, he cannot vſe a better policie, then to helpe himſelfe with the fraud of this traytor, in imparting that vnto him that he hath no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to do, and fayning that he hath doubt of things that he feareth nothing at all, and that he deſireth that his enemies ſhould do thoſe things which he would in no caſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhould do, and this may be an occaſion that his ſayd enemies may take ſome enterpriſe in hand, thinking aſſuredly that they do knowe his ſecrets, and thereby he may ſurpriſe them at his aduantage, hauing deceiued them voluntarily. <hi>Ventidius</hi> helped himſelfe with this policie agaynſt the <hi>Parthians.</hi> If the Generall haue determined, or if he be conſtrained to ſend part of his people out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Camp to ſuccour any man, as I haue ſaid, <hi>Claudius Nero</hi> ſuccoured his companion, and that they both were lodged very
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:10495:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>
néere vnto their enemies; if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſayd Generall would that his ſayd enemies ſhould not perceiue that his Campe were weakned of people, he muſt leaue the lodgings of thoſe that are departed in the ſame ſtate that they alwaies were in, and the Enſignes like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe and the ſame number of fiers that were there accuſtomed to be made: and furthermore, the watch muſt be made as ſtrong as euer it was. On the other part, he vnto whom the ſuccour is ſent, if he would deceiue his enemies, ought to take heed not to enlarge his Camp, nor to ſuffer any newe lodgings to be made, nor to make ſhew of any other Enſignes then thoſe which were accuſtomed to bee ſeene, but thoſe which come laſt muſt lodge with the firſt: to weet, Captaines with Captaines, Lieutenants with Lieutenants, Enſigne-bearers with Enſigne-bearers, and conſequently officers with officers, and ſimple Souldiers with their like, like as thoſe of the ſayd <hi>Nero</hi> did with thoſe of <hi>Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator.</hi> If our Generall deſire at any time to knowe ſure newes of the enemies buſines, he may imitate <hi>Scipio,</hi> who being in <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica</hi> againſt the <hi>Carthagenians,</hi> ſent certain of his men in Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage vnto <hi>Siphax,</hi> fayning to treate of an agreement betwixt them; with whoſe ſeruants he mingled certaine Captaines of his of the moſt experteſt he had, who were ſimply apparelled like vnto ſeruants, expreſly for to ſpie the ſtate of his enemies fully: when as the ſayd Ambaſſadours were ariued before <hi>Siphax,</hi> and doing their charge, the ſpies in the meane while tooke occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to do their buſines by one of their horſes which they did let ſcape, to the intent to followe him throughout the hoaſt, and to marke all things at their pleaſure: whereof they made their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port vnto the ſayd <hi>Scipio;</hi> who being aduertiſed of all, ſurpriſed two mightie Camps in one morning. A Generall might like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe baniſh ſome one of his familiars, and fayne ſome great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt them, which might retire vnto his enemies, and from thence giue aduertiſement of their eſtate: he may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſometimes vnderſtand their ſecretes by priſoners, and by ſpies that he ſendeth into their Campe, vnder colour of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing victualls, or to ſerue there for ſome other turne. And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſome of the chiefeſt of the ſayd enemies armie may bee corrupted, in ſuche ſort that they may giue aduertiſement.
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:10495:121" rendition="simple:additions"/>
For what is it that couetouſneſſe will not do amongſt men? True it is, that for to maintaine theſe ſpyes and traytors, the Generall ought to ſpare nothing, becauſe that the want of not hauing ofttimes newes of enemies procéedings, doth make vs ſometimes to feele the ſmart of it: whereas onely good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſement might bee the occaſion of the winning of a whole warre. For to prooue what truſt a man may haue in a towne, or in a whole countrie, he may helpe himſelfe with the policie of <hi>Marius,</hi> who being occupied in the wars againſt the <hi>Cimbres,</hi> and willing to make proofe of the faith of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> which dwelt in the parts of <hi>Italie,</hi> which we call <hi>Lumbardie</hi> at this day, and who were in aliance with the <hi>Romanes</hi> at that time, he ſent them two packes of Letters, the one open and the other ſealed: In the open Letters it was forbidden them, that they ſhould by no meanes open the ſealed Letters, but at a certaine day: but they could not ſo long forbeare but did open them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their terme: and therevpon the Letters being demaunded againe by the ſaid <hi>Marius,</hi> he perceiued manifeſtly that he ought not to truſt them no more then needed.</p>
                     <p>If a Prince were aſſayled in his owne countrie that would not attend at home for the warres, he may enter vpon another part of his enemies countrie, and by that meanes conſtraine him to returne for to defend his owne: I meane, if the ſayd Prince haue his townes ſtronger and better prouided for, or his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie ſtronger and more difficile then his enemies. If our Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall do find himſelfe to bee beſieged by his enemies in any parte that he could not eſcape without ſhame, or loſſe, in this caſe he may practiſe to agree with them, and to take truce: for in mine opinion they will then become ſo negligent, that eaſely he may eſcape their hands, or in the meane time while ſuch agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are in hand, or whileſt he hath truce, he might practiſe to do his enemie a miſchiefe: for it is then that the ſcourge will be giuen better then at any other time: and when the miſchiefe is once happened, he may ſay: I haue been deceiued vnder ſhadow of true meaning: but to thinke that an armie ouerthrowne, or a place gotten, whileſt the entercourſe doth continue, ſhould bee repayred or reſtored by the deceiuer, is a vayne hope: for I know
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:10495:121" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not what we would do our ſelues if it were ſo that we ſhould at any time haue the like aduantage of our enemies. When the Generall ſhould find himſelfe at any time in that danger not to depart out of a place without vſing ſome pollicie, he muſt exco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitate all the inuentions that may ſerue his turne, and proue them all one after another, vntill ſuch time as ſome one may do him good. Amongſt others he may proue theſe two, the one is to aſſayle his enemies on the one ſide with a ſmall number of ſouldiers, and the moſt reſolute men: and with the others in the meane time to do all indeuour to open the paſſage on the other ſide, whileſt the enemies are buſied to reſiſt their aſſaults; the other manner is to inuent ſome new thing to amaze his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to cauſe them to kéepe themſelues cloſe vpon their gard, doubting that this noueltie hath ſome dangerous taile after it, and this muſt be done by night to amaze them the more. <hi>Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball</hi> eſcaped the hands of <hi>Fabius</hi> by that meanes, cauſing fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots to be made faſt vnto the hornes of a great multitude of Oxen that he had in his Campe, which being ſet on fire, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to be driuen towards <hi>Fabius</hi> his hoaſt, and this ſight was thought to be ſo wonderfull and ſtrange vnto the ſaid <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi> that he doubted to be ſurpriſed, ſpecially being in a darke night, he durſt not ſtart out of his fort vntill it was day. The ſaid Generall ought to ſtudie by all meanes poſſible to make his enemies to be iealous, and to ſuſpect and miſtruſt one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and beare as great an enuy one to another as might be poſſible: and this may he do, by preſeruing the goods and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions of ſome of them, and by ſpoiling all that may be found of the others: and moreouer, by reſtoring their children, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and friends, that he hath taken in the warres, vnto their owne fathers and parents, without taking any raunſome of any of them: and it cannot be poſſible but that this good déede will proffit either to winne the hearts of thoſe vnto whome the good hath bin done, or make diſſention amongſt them that haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued it, and others which will miſlike it.

Their Prince might likewiſe be ſo ſuſpitious, that he might reiect the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from his perſon, or might cauſe them to be ſlaine, as <hi>Iugurtha</hi> did cauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefeſt of his Counſaile, becauſe of the letters that <hi>Metellus</hi> did write vnto them, albeit they were nothing in fault. <hi>Anniball</hi> after that he was ouerthrowne by <hi>Scipio,</hi> reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto King <hi>Antiochus,</hi> with whome he was alwayes well entertained, vntill the comming of the Ambaſſadors fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                        <hi>Rome,</hi> who frequented him ſo often, and after ſo many manners, that the ſaid <hi>Antiochus</hi> thought they had intelligence together, and therefore would neuer after be counſailed by him, and ſo poore <hi>Anniball</hi> loſt his credit through the ſubtletie of the <hi>Romans.</hi> It ſhall likewiſe not be amiſſe for the Generall to imploy his care to deuide the forces of his enemies, if the aſſembly be of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſorts of people, ſpecially hauing meane to make a courſe vpon ſome of their countreys, for in ſending thither a ſufficient number of ſouldiers, thoſe which are left in the countrey will quickly call their men backe againe for to defend their owne countrey. The <hi>Spanyards</hi> vſed this pollicy againſt our people, while the King was at <hi>Pauy:</hi> for knowing the number of the <hi>Gryſons</hi> that were there (the which wanting, our campe was greatly weakened) for they ſent the <hi>Caſtelein</hi> of <hi>Mur</hi> then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or otherwiſe the Marqueſſe <hi>Mortane,</hi> to runne into the countrey of the ſaid <hi>Gryſons,</hi> for which occaſion, they did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon vs at our néede, to goe to defend their owne countrey, yet they might haue done well inough without going, if they had willed, conſidering y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> force of the countrey where they dwel,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:10495:122" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which in my iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt ſtrongeſt &amp; hardeſt that may be ſéene: and beſides, ſo well peopled, that the number of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people which the <hi>Caſtelein</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ducted vpon their frontiers, were not to feare them in that manner that they made ſhew: neither for the loſſe of one Caſtell ought they to haue abandoned vs as they did: notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding it is one of the tricks that ſtrangers do play ordinarily with thoſe which ground themſelues too much vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> waging of other people, then their owne proper nation. If the Generall ſhould be in camp ſo néere his enemies y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thoſe of both parts did looke for the battaile from time to time, &amp; that there were other people co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming vnto his aſſiſtance, if he feared that his enemies would goe &amp; méet them vpon the way to fight with them, to cut them off before they ſhould ioine with him, he might make the brute to runne throughout his hoaſt, that euery man ſhould be ready by an houre, or the next day to enter into battaile, and might let ſcape ſome priſoner that might aduertiſe his enemies of this determination: and in mine opinion this will be a meane to kéepe them together within their Campe, without ſending any body out, nor diminiſhing their forces, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their accoumpt to be fought withall at the houre ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of, &amp; by that meanes the bands which are to come, might ariue ſafe &amp; whole. To giue an enemy an occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to weaken his army, the beſt way were to let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to come far into the countrey, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon all the townes vnto him that could not be kept out of his hands: and it is to be thought, that to kéepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all, he would put garriſon into them, and by that meanes his forces would be deminiſhed, &amp; then he might be fought withall vpon the letting goe of his people, to imbrace more things then he could well defend. And furthermore, a Generall may ſometimes vſe diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation in his enterpriſes: as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is determined to go into one countrey, to make the brute to run that he pretendeth to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle another, &amp; muſt vſe extreame dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to conquer the ſame ſaid countrey which looked in no manner of wiſe for his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming before they might be prouided for to defend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, or before his enemies might be tranſported thither for to kéepe it.

were deſperate, and offer battaile in this rage: he ought to kéepe himſelfe within his fort, and to defer the combat as long as he may: and it may be that within few daies he ſhall haue them all at his mercy without ſtriking ſtroke. A Generall may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times haue to do with people ill practiſed, and too couragious: who ſo much abandon themſelues to purſue thoſe that flye, that oftentimes there is no meane to retire them, vntill ſuch time as they are fouly beaten, ſo that if the ſaid Generall wil looke to his buſines, he may eaſily find an oportunity to do the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a maruellous damage in a ſmall time, for as much as he may lay his ambuſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es on y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> part of his enemies camp y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſéemeth to be moſt ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt, and where at no time there hath bin any fight or ſkirmiſh offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſo that the place be fit to hide his people: and ordaine his ſkirmiſhes towards the other part where they are accuſtomed to be fought withall, and muſt entice them ſo cunningly, that they may come all out of their Camp if it be poſſible: or at the leaſt that the watch on that part that his men are hidden might come to ſée the paſtime: wherein there is no doubt that they will kéepe themſelues from running out, ſo that the ſaid Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall his men do retire ſometime to entice them out ſo much the more, and to drawe them the farther from their fort. Which being done, the ſaid Generall may giue a ſigne by certaine ſhots of the Ordnance, or by ſome other meane, vnto thoſe that are in the ambuſh: at which ſigne, they muſt charge vpon their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes camp ſo ſwift &amp; fiercely, without being perceiued of their enemies, or of very fewe, that fort may be gotten before the ſaid enemies do ſée into their owne errour. It ſhall be neceſſary ſometimes when two armyes are lodged neere one to another, that the ſaid Generall ſhould ſend out certaine of his people to ouerrunne &amp; pillage the countrey that is in his ſubiection vnder collour of enemies, to make his aduerſaries to thinke them to be their ſouldiers, or new ſuccour that doth come vnto them, &amp; ſo running to méete them in hope to haue their part of the pray, may be endomaged and ſurpriſed. A Generall may alſo make great deſtruction of his enemies, in giuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> occaſion to eate and drinke diſordinatly, I meane, hauing to do with thoſe nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are ſubiect vnto Wine. He might make ſhewe that he
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:10495:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>
dare not abide them: and for a collour abandon his Campe, which he might leaue in as great diſorder as might be poſſible, to the intent to diſſemble his pretence the better, and might leaue his bagage, tents, and all the reſt in their eſtate, and his Campe as well furniſhed with Wine, and meates ready dreſt, as he might poſſible, to the intent that his enemyes entring after his departure, might fill their bellyes with the victuals that his men had left: and when as the ſaid Generall ſhall thinke his ſaid aduerſaryes to be ouercome with Wine, and ſléeping like Beaſts, he may returne vpon them, and ouerthrow them: for it is to be preſumed that hauing them at that point, he might haue of them as good a market as he would himſelfe. <hi>Grimault,</hi> King of the <hi>Lombards</hi> did once ouerthrowe the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> at <hi>Aſt</hi> by this pollicie, and many others haue vſed it. For to deceiue the enemyes, we ought oftentimes to change our manner of doing, or if not often, at the leaſt ſometimes: I ſpeake not of the order of the Battailes, nor of the lodging of a Campe, nor of other generalties: but I ſpeake of little ſmall things, which haue but ſmall ſhewe a farre off, and at hand do ſerue more then we thinke for: as this of a certaine Captaine, who to haue it ſignified that his enemyes marched through the countrey, cauſed a ſigne to be made with fire by night, and with ſmoke by day, and knowing that his enemyes were aduertiſed of theſe ſignes, and therefore were the more wary, knowing that they were diſcouered: wherefore to take them in the ſnare, he was driuen to vſe ſome pollicy, which he did after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: that is, he appointed his people to make fire and ſmoke as well by day as by night, without ceaſing, whether they ſawe enemy or none: and that when as they did ſée the enemyes ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye, they ſhould make neither the one, nor the other. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ordained as I haue ſaid, was executed from point to point by thoſe which had the charge, and when as his enemyes were in the fildes, the ſignes ceaſſed, and thereby the Captaine of whome I make mention at this preſent, knewe that his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes approched: the which on the other part ſéeing the accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed ſignes to faile, thought they were come the watches not knowing, and therefore they were ſo much the leſſe carefull
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:10495:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to march in good order: whereas the ſaid Captaine was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prouided, and comforted in his buſines, waighting to charge vpon his enemies, which he did, ouerthrowing them quite, and deſtroying the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vtterly. <hi>Mennon</hi> of <hi>Rhodes</hi> finding no meanes to drawe his enemyes out of a moſt ſtrong place that they were in, to cauſe them to come to the Combat in an open place; ſent vnto the Camp of his aduerſaries one of his houſhold ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, vnder collour of a fugitine, who gaue them to vnderſtand that the people of the ſaid <hi>Mennon</hi> were mutined together, &amp; that for that cauſe the greateſt part went away at that inſtant: and to the intent that there might be the greater credit giuen vnto his words, there were ſent away certaine bands, whome they ſawe to depart from the ſaid Campe: and ſo vnderſtoode that there was a great tumult, which was done of purpoſe: and being perſwaded by the ſaid fugitiue to take that opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and moued through the diſorder that they thought for a certaintie to be in the Campe of the ſaid <hi>Mennon,</hi> they were ſo euill aduiſed, that they iſſued out of their ſtrong place to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle thoſe who afterwards ouerthrew them. There are many other pollicies to be vſed then theſe that I haue ſpoken of héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>before, that haue bin put in practiſe to hurt an enemy, which I might haue inferred in this place, as well as thoſe that I haue ſpoken off.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue ſhewed before how townes ſuſpected might ſometimes happen to fall into our hands without ſtriking ſtroke: thoſe whom we do miſtruſt. But ſuppoſe that there are Townes, not only ſuſpected, but alſo haue declared themſelues to be enemies, ſo that there is no remedie but to procéede againſt them in this buſines by armes, and to proue to conquer by force y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which we haue failed to get by pollicie. In this buſines there are two meanes to be vſed, the one is, to ouercome the townes
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:10495:125"/>
either by aſſault, or by compoſition. In the firſt we may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe vſe two other meanes, to wéete, force mingled with fraud, or manifeſt violence: I call it force mingled with fraud, when we haue any intelligence with the ſouldiers of the garriſon, or with the Citizens: by whoſe meanes we attaine to get or win a good part of the inhabitants, or of the men of war who kéep the townes, to enter into them the reſt not knowing. I tearme it to be manifeſt violence when as we aſſault a towne vnlooked for, or at our firſt arriuall, not ſtaying whilſt the Ordnance hath beaten the walls: or when we do aſſault it, after that there is a breach made. As touching that point that the townes do fall ſometimes into our hands by compoſition, we muſt note that this compoſition is voluntary or forced. Voluntary hath place when as a towne doth deliuer it ſelf from the iuriſdiction of one, to giue it frée vnto another, as <hi>Geneua</hi> hath done within theſe few yeares, hoping to be better gouerned by the <hi>Switzers,</hi> then ſhe was by her Duke. And <hi>Caſall</hi> of <hi>Montferat</hi> called in the <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> and gaue her ſelfe vnto the King, deſiring rather to be on his ſide then on the Emperours: I knowe not vppon what conſideration this ſaid voluntary compoſition is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: likewiſe when as a towne doth giue it ſelfe vnto a Prince to be mainteined againſt her enemyes, as <hi>Genes</hi> did, who gaue her ſelfe vnto King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeuenth, throwing her ſelf into his armes, to be defended from King <hi>Alphonſus</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> who made her warres: but becauſe this péece doth nothing ſerue my purpoſe, I will leaue it aſide, and will ſpeake nothing of it. Concerning forced compoſition, either it proceedeth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> long ſiege that is kept before a place, or through the courſes which are continually made, not beſieging it neere, by which courſes the countrey is ouerrunne, pillaged, and deſtroyed, and the goods of the inhabitants, and of thoſe that are retired thither, if they be of the countrey: and furthermore, in keeping them ſubiect in ſuch ſort, that they can not iſſue out of their gates, without danger of their perſons: nor ſuffer victuals, or any other prouiſion to enter without great difficultie: for which cauſe, the ſayde inhabitants ſhall be conſtrayned to yéeld themſelues and their towne vnto thoſe which doe ſo
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:10495:126"/>
hardly deale with them, leaſt they ſhould be afterwards euill v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Alſo townes ſometimes yéeld themſelues not ſéeing their enemies, finding themſelues too weake for to reſiſt them. The two meanes then which are vſed to get Townes are thoſe that I haue ſpoken of. Wherefore a Lieutenant Generall may helpe himſelfe with either of them which he findeth moſt eaſie, and may practiſe it after that manner that a wiſe Captaine ought to put it in execution. Me thinke he may vſe it after this manner that I am about to declare, except he may be better counſailed, and that is, before all thinges he diligently enquire of all the points that concerne this buſines, that is to weet, whether the towne that he pretendeth to beſiege, be ſtrong by nature, or by arte: whether it be ſubiect to batterie or no, and to haue it in portrature, with the ſcituation of the countrey round about it, if it be poſſible. Furthermore, whether it may be mined or not: whether they do kéepe good watch, or do doubt any thing: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they do make any preparation at that inſtant, or haue done it before hand: whether it be well furniſhed with all ſtore, or if it want, if it may be victualled from time to time, and relieued in deſpite of thoſe that beſiege it: or be cut off, that neither vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals nor ſuccour can enter: what garriſon it hath: what Chiefs: what will the inhabitants haue: and finally, whether the ſaid inhabitants and ſouldiers do agrée together, or if there be any controuerſie and factions betwixt them. Which aduertiſements are of ſuch importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that they deſerue to be bought with their waight in gold: and to this end a Generall ought to entertaine certaine good ſpyes, and ſhould ſéeke to haue intelligence in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and diuers places, to be aduertiſed often and perticularly of all things truly: before he thruſt himſelfe into this daunce: and after that he hath knowne the truth of all things, of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes eſtate, he muſt make his principall foundation vppon one of the pointes aboueſayd, which is beſt for his purpoſe: as if the towne be much eaſier to myne, then to batter, he ſhall ground his principall hope vppon the myne: or if it were ill victualled, he might attend to conquer it through famine, or may vſe any of the other meanes which he thinketh may helpe himſelfe beſt. Aboue all things he muſt rather vſe
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:10495:126"/>
force mingled with fraude: then with manifeſt violence; if it were ſo that hee might vſe either of thoſe two forces which hee thought beſt: and if ſo be that he ſhould haue to do with a ſtrong and puiſſant towne, I would neuer be of opinion he ſhould vſe any force, if he might haue it louinglie and by honeſt compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for beſides that, that hee ſhall auoide a meruelous coſt, and the death of many honeſt men, which may happen on both ſids, he ſhal keepe the ſame towne afterwards which he hath gotten by the ſaide compoſition with leſſe difffcultie (the inhabitants nor others hauing receiued either ſhame or damage by any of his) then if he conquered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by force of armes: and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie if they weare hurt in bodie or goods. To win them then by this gratious meanes, a Generall ought to ſpare neither mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney nor wordes; money to corrupt the chiefeſt, and thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue credit among the communaltie; and words to perſwade the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, or the Souldiers by liuelie reaſons that they ought to yeelde: and for that this office may not well bee executed by himſelfe, not hauing the commoditie to vſe ſpeach vnto his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies but in his hoaſt, hee ought to haue about him men for to handle this buſines who are great perſwaders of themſelues &amp; fayre ſpeakers. The Trumpetters and the Drummes ought likewiſe to knowe this art, for becauſe that they are much more permitted to go and come euerie where vppon euerie light oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, then are any other of greater mettle. There may alſo be others ſent vnder collour of fugitiues, &amp; by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may al meanes be practiſed to taſte the minds of his enimies, and to cauſe them to yeelde vnto his will, not conſtrayning them at all. When there is queſtion to win a towne by ſuch like meanes wee muſt firſt conſider the occaſion it hath to defend it ſelf: to wit, if it bee the townes owne proper quarrell, or if it touch them little. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards if the quarrell bee theirs, to knowe truelie if any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame neceſſitie hath conſtrained them thereunto or not: as if it had rebelled againſt the King, &amp; that it had committed ſome heynous facte: I ſpeake not of the townes of this Realme: who are inhabited with people ſo well minded that it is not to be thought that euer they will fall into this cryme, &amp; therefore I need not to ſpeake of them: but when I ſpeake of Townes, I
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:10495:127"/>
meane thoſe that are out of the realme which euer and anone do rebell and reuolt, and in reuolting doe ſometimes kill their gouernours, and cut in peeces the gariſon they haue: we muſt think that thoſe townes where this like offence ſhould happen, would fight &amp; defend themſelues much more obſtinately, then if they had not any waies offended: becauſe of the puniſhment y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their offence deſerueth: which (according to their opinion) will fall vpon their neckes, if that they may be ouercome. We may likewiſe make our accompte that the townes which by nature doe hate vs, as the <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> and the <hi>Flemmings:</hi> or which haue our honor in ieloſie and deſire to rule ouer their neghbors, as the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the <hi>Almaignes,</hi> will yeelde as late as may bee poſſible: and with greate hardnes will they be gotten without vſing of force. Notwithſtanding a Lieutenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſhall make a proofe before all other things if the two cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, I haue ſpoken of, to weet, giftes, and words, may do him any ſeruice: for many good townes, and places impregnable, haue bin conqueſted in ſhorte time by them two: and many things that were thought impoſſible, haue yeelded eaſilie at the length, through their meanes. Therefore they that ſhall haue the charge to conferre with theſe ſaid townes, or to ſummon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the behalfe of the General, ought to imploie al their wits to take from the inhabitants, rebels, as others, this ſaide neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, and afterwards there obſtinacie, in promiſing moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and merueyles, and that they ſhall bee pardoned, if they feare to be puniſhed for their rebellion. Likewiſe if it be againſt a people that are in doubt to leeſe their libertie, and which haue learned to liue vnder their owne lawes not obeyeing vnto anie man, they ſhal giue them to vnderſtand that it is better for them to be gouerned by one only Chiefe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by a whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munaltie: ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they may be maintaned in good peace poſſeſſing their goods with quiet, without being moleſted or tyrannized by any man: whereof they might bee ſure being vnder the protection of ſo a good Prince, as is he, for whome thoſe words are ſpoken: and furthermore that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King his pretence doth extend but to quench the ambition of certaine perticular perſones, and not that the people ſhould come into bondage: ſhewing them moreouer the miſchiefe
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:10495:127"/>
moreouer the miſchiefe that may happen vnto their towne if it were beſieged, &amp; to the country round about it, and beſides the deſolations, murders, forces, and violences, which are made in the taking of a town, &amp; to giue them the better encouragement to this matter, to ſhewe the welfare that maye happen vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in generall, in hauing of the good fauor of ſo mighty a king. Concerning the townes that are not conſtrained to defend them ſelues through any extreame neceſſity, but onely make wars to take part with others, wee muſt ſay that they make warres of themſelues, or that they doe fauour an enemy: if ſo bee that they make wars of themſelues, there will not bee ſo great difficulty to win them, as when they do defend themſelues of neceſſity, for they will ſoone be weary of the great expences and danger that they do put themſelues into for other mens quarrels, &amp; in thys caſe, there muſt be faier promiſes made to winne them, to cauſe them to abandon the aliance of the ſaid enemy: but when as they do but fauour an enemy, it is either with the conſent of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, or againſt their willes: if it bee againſt their willes, the way is open to perſwade them all that the aforeſaid Generall will: and if it be with there wills, there muſt bee paines taken to corrupt the principall Chiefes, and certaine Captains, or other officers amongſt the ſouldiers, who may make them to beleeue that their towne is not defencible, or that they ſhould not be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured in time, or if the town did ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>par, they might hinder forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by working ſloly: &amp; if they were ſouldiers, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> did worke, they might ſow ſome voice amongſt them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:10495:128"/>
to defend it ſelfe, as the Emperour might haue wiſhed it to be: and notwithſtanding it held certaine daies, making of neceſſity, a vertue. Theſe things might rather be put in proofe, then the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of force. He muſt conſider if the towne which he doth prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe to get, be in eſtate to abide a ſiege, and to continewe it long or not, and if it bee ſufficiently prouided, and alwaies kept with good watch, the meane aforeſaid muſt be put in proofe. But when as it ſhalbe vnprouided of things neceſſary, &amp; hath not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gune to prouide before hand, it is then time to aboord it, whileſt it is vnprouided. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> tooke this oportunitie when as the Lord <hi>Bonneuall</hi> did but enter in at <hi>Lodes:</hi> for before he had deuided the quarters, &amp; appointed what part euery band ſhould kéep, they were at the gates, whervpon the ſaid towne finding it ſelf vnready in al points, was won by aſſault. We muſt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take theſe oportunities, &amp; not let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſlip, becauſe it is to be feared, how little leaſure ſo euer they may haue, &amp; whileſt we go &amp; come, that they would make the place ſtrong, and furniſhe it with all that it ſhould haue need of, which is an oportunity that ought to be taken from an enemy, &amp; not to be giuen him. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the ſaid generall wil haue this aduantage, or other vpon his enemies, he muſt haue a care to know their buſines trewly, as I haue ſaid: &amp; determine thervpon afterwardes how he may proceed moſt ſureſt. In mine opinion, if a towne be in diuiſion, to wit, if there be ſtrife between the inhabitants, or amongſt the ſouldiers, or between the inhabitants &amp; the ſouldiers, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ought not to léeſe ſuch an oportunity, but to do al his endeuor to come before it, furniſhed with many ladders to ſtall it, &amp; with other light ingins, to beat down gates and walles, whileſt they within do think vpon other matters, &amp; theſe enterprizes muſt be executed in comming far of: for how furder of the generall doth come (ſo that he make great ſpeed) the more he ſhal amaze his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, when they ſhal ſee him at their gates, becauſe they dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing: at which place when he is ariued, he muſt aſſault it ſo quikly, &amp; hotly on al ſides that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inhabitants ſhould not know vnto what Sainct to bequethe themſelues, except they yeeld at the very inſtant that he did ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon them, for if he giue them but a quarter of an hower reſpit to counſaile together, &amp; look about,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:10495:128"/>
he ſhall finde that the common daunger wherein they are all, that are with in the towne, wil cauſe them to remember them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and to defend their perſons and town together: wheras if he do not giue them leaſure to bethinke themſelues, beeing ſo ſuddainly ſupprized (with the diſtruſt that they haue one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) the greateſt haſt that the town will make, wil be to yeld it ſelfe. Me thinke alſo that a towne where there are diuers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers (as in <hi>Italie)</hi> may eaſily be gotten, by means of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence had with one of the partes, who might giue enteraunce into the towne, at ſome place, were it by night or by daye: or if the walles were well kept, then thoſe with whome the Generall had this intelligence, might ſeaze vpon the voyd pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ſtrong buildings within the towne: and at ſome certain ſigne giuen, he might appoint to beginne the broile within, and aſſaulte the towne without at the gates and walles, which do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I dare beleeue, that the moſt hardieſt, and moſt aſſuredſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, would abandon their defences incontinent, to ſaue their liues, ſeeing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be aſſaulted in ſo many places at once. By that meanes was <hi>Genes</hi> taken in the yeere 1527. in the name of the king, by the Lorde <hi>Caeſar Fregoſe.</hi> I make mine account, that if the ſaid Lord had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt time giuen intelligence vnto thoſe of the league, as he did at the firſt, that it had bene ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken againe without any difficulty, and that he had not bene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed as he was. But he meaning to ſurprize it by full aſſault, doubting that if he aduertiſed his friendes, that thoſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary part ſhoulde haue knowen it alſo: and truſting his parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers would haue bin ready enough, when as they ſhould heare his name cried, would not that any man ſhold know of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: which was cauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his partakers had rather at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to keepe their town with one common accord, with his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies then not taking arms, to abide y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aduenture, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for whom or what. It may bee alſo that they doubted that they ſhould haue had their rewarde with their contrary parties, if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>Frenchmen</hi> had gotten the town at that inſtant: for that in ſuch like buſines there is no men ſpared, which is an il caſe, and ought to be looked into: for it is enough to choke all thoſe that might haue will to receiue vs into their townes, by the meane
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:10495:129"/>
that is ſpoken of, knowing that diuers other haue bin euill vſed. Moreouer as it is good to beſiege a towne before it be prouided of thoſe things y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it hath néed of: ſo is it as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient to aſſault it, when as it doth ſtand vpon his gard, both for the little eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the Citizens will make of their enemies, thinking that they wold not aſſault the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſpecially if they were far of: &amp; for that their Chiefes are men of ſo ſmall experience, and the people &amp; ſouldiers ſo ſubiect to their pleaſures, that they would keep but little watch or none at al. And for the handling of this buſines, a Generall ought to chuſe ſome one in his armie that were a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient man to execute an enterpriſe of great importance, &amp; giue him ſome ſuch number of ſouldiers as were thought neceſſary, who ſhould be furniſhed with victuals for a certaine time, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to cary it at their backes to take the leſſe baggage with them at their departure. And although y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſaid General were far of that hindreth not, ſo that hee make ſhew to ſome other place, and giue out ſpeech ſo: or that he that is ſent do depart by night ſecretly. In laying theſe enterpriſes to worke, hee muſt foreſee whether that after the town ſhalbe taken by his men, it may be defended againſt thoſe that would recouer it againe from them or not, for it is not al to get into a place, bicauſe it is a thing that may be eaſily done, by means of the ſurprizes that may be vſed in ſuch caſes, &amp; of the intelligence that may be had: but in keepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it afterwardes is all the difficulty, if y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it bee entred with an opinion, that is to ſay, with too little companye: eſpecialy if the town were deuided, &amp; that the one league did maintain the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary part, for it wold be to begin again a new euery day, except the ſaid league were driuen out at that inſtant that it were take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the principals were laid hands on, &amp; thoſe that might cauſe any commotion, which is one of the beſt remedies that may bee vſed, &amp; to make ſome part of the towne ſtrong, to haue their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge to it at their néed: when as all the town could not be kept, or y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſurprizer ſhould be repulſed by his enemies, who might be brought into the ſame towne by his contrary party, if ſo be y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the towne were left in her entire, which woul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

and by would ioyne with them: and ſo thoſe that thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be maiſters, ſhall bee driuen out againe: and might bee taken, in taking: by ſuffering their aduerſaries to haunt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, &amp; wanting place of ſafetie, not hauing made ſome fortreſſe before in ſome part of the towne, to retire vnto at their need, as I haue ſayd. If it were ſo that there were neuer a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell in the ſayd towne, or if there were any which were not in their cuſtodie: in whiche caſe likewiſe the ſurprizers muſt looke well vnto their buſines, becauſe that if within the towne there be any Caſtle or Fortreſſe which is in the hands of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries, they may at all houres be aſſaulted by it: for that the ſayd aduerſarie may receiue ayd at all times, ſpecially if the ſayd Caſtle haue iſſue into the fields. And it helpeth not although that the inhabitants of the towne did call them of their owne free willes, if that their enemies be ſtronger then both they and their aſſiſtants: for that the ſayd enemies may haue entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the towne by the aforeſayd Caſtle at all houres, except the towne were very well fortified, and that the paſſage out of the ſayd Caſtle into the towne were rampared in ſuch ſort that they might abide all commers, or els it is to bee thought that they ſhould bee conſtrayned to leaue their prize, what helpe or fauour the inhabitants might giue them. And beſides that they ſhalbe conſtrayned to leaue their towne ſo, they ſhall be in hazard to be ouerthrowne, and the towne pillaged, as <hi>Breſſe</hi> was. The <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> which had taken it with the conſent of the citizens, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouerthrowne by the Lord of <hi>Foix,</hi> who got this victorie by meanes of the Caſtle which held on his ſide. My Lord Marſhall of <hi>Foix</hi> got <hi>Cremone</hi> againe alſo, by meanes of the Caſtle: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the towne was not pillaged, nor thoſe that had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it to rebel, ſlaine: yet was it in great hazard to haue béen ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. <hi>Caſall</hi> of <hi>Mountferat</hi> hath felt the ſmart of it, and thoſe which tooke it likewiſe: for the towne was ſacked, &amp; the <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> that entred into it were all ſlaine or taken. It is therefore neceſſarie to looke well into this buſines, before the taking in hand of a matter ſo daungerous, and to go ſo well accompanied that an enemie may haue no aduauntage, although that he had intelligence within the towne, or that the Caſtle (if there were
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:10495:130"/>
any) did take his part, by whoſe ayde he might recouer that he had loſt. But let vs paſſe further, and let vs put caſe that the townes which do reſiſt are ſo well prouided of all things, and ſo well guided, that there is no hope left to conquer them, by ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, nor by intelligence, nor otherwiſe then by méere force. We muſt ſay, that if the aforeſayd Generall do go to beſiege one of them, he ought to do it with the determination not to depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it vntill ſuch time as he haue taken it: for that if he beſiege a towne, and do depart without the taking of it, he doth giue the other townes ſo much the more encouragement to reſiſt him. Wherefore the ſayd Generall ought to conſider before hand of the force and ſtrength of the towne he pretendeth to beſiege: to know whether it may be taken or not. If it may be taken by anye one of thoſe meanes that townes are accuſtomed to bee won, althogh that it be furniſhed with things neceſſary, let him go boldly. But if ſo be it were ſo ſtrong of people, &amp; ſo wel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, that it would bee inuincible, it would bee time loſt to prooue it: beſides the ſhame and the loſſe that he ſhould receiue. In this caſe hee muſt try another way, that is to ſee if he might in continuaunce of time get it with long moleſting it: which to do, he muſt put his people round about it into the other towns &amp; forts that are at his obedience, and diſtrubute them by Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, by which Gariſons there may bee courſes made howerly againſt the towne which he doth trouble, pretending to conquer it by that meanes. And if there were no townes neare enough, the ſaid General might keepe a flying camp round about it, the which ſhould neither bee farre from it, nor neare, and in mine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, it is better to followe this counſaile: although it were ſomewhat farre of, then to beſiege ſuch a town with all his force at hand: for by meanes of the courſes that may bee made out of the Gariſons, it wil bee a great maruaile, if the towne at length doe not famiſh, or do not agree to ſome compoſition, howe long ſoeuer it do hold out. Beſides that there happen accidents from time to time vnlookt for, which may make a warre quickly won or loſt: whereas to enterpriſe a thing impoſſible, is as much as to beat a man his fiſt againſt a wall, and there can no good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede of it: conſidering the expences that ſhall bee made to no
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:10495:130"/>
purpoſe; the loſſe of time, and valiaunt men that are deſtroyed at ſuche like places: ſo that who ſo would make account of the paines taken in the beſieging of a ſtrong town, and that which it coſteth before it bee conquered by force of armes, with the profite that the conquerour hath afterwardes when it is in hys handes: ſhall finde that the paine and the charges doe farre ſurmount the profite. And I dare ſaye, that the conqueſt of a great countrey may bee eaſier made, then the taking of one of theſe ſtrong and obſtinate townes, for in conquering a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, wee might helpe our ſelues, with our Militarie Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and win a battaile, through good order, if it come there too: but to take one towne well in order, there is a thouſand dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties. But ſith I ſpeake of theſe ſtrong townes, I wil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what towne or place it is that I eſtéeme to bee inuincible or at the leaſt very hard to be taken, &amp; againſt which, we ſhould get more by making wars warlike out of gariſons then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, for that there is no other meane to entice the Garriſon of the ſame towne, into the fielde to fight with it. I ſaye that towne is inuincible, that is, as ſtrong of people, and aſwell fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with all prouiſions, as are thoſe that doe beſiege it, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the fortreſſe of the towne which the beſieged haue for their aduantage, as the <hi>Spaniardes</hi> had, being beſieged within <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> by the Lord of <hi>Lautrec,</hi> who were as ſtrong in all points, as wee were; excepting good hartes. Or although the ſaide towne be not altogether ſo ſtrong of people, at the vttermoſt if it haue men enowe to furniſh the walles and Bulwarks round about it from place to place: and moreouer a good number to defend the breaches which thoſe that are without, might make. And if a Towne bee ſo furniſhed although that the walles, and the other defences be not of the beſt, yet it may be accompted to be moſt ſtrong: becauſe that the ſureſt walles, and defences that may be made, are men: ſo that they be good. Euerie man kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth wel that <hi>Perone</hi> was too weake of it ſelfe, to reſiſt the one halfe of the armie of <hi>Flemings</hi> and <hi>Almaignes</hi> that did beſiege it: notwithſtanding the vertue of the Lorde Marſhall of the Marche, and his men made it inuincible. It is but 18. yeares ſince <hi>Meziers</hi> was founde vnprouided of all thinges neceſſarie
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:10495:131"/>
to make a Towne ſtrong: and notwithſtanding the <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> which were within it, amongſt whoſe principall Chiefs (as I haue vnderſtoode) was the Lord Conſtable, did keepe it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the power of an Emperour. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> would neuer ſuffer that their Cities ſhoulde bee encloſed with walles, ſaying that the people woulde become laſie and of little valew: becauſe that they would put their chiefeſt truſt in their fortreſſe, and not in their armes, and in trueth neceſſitie cauſeth many great matters to be done: ſpecially if the men employed in this buſines, are ſomewhat couragious, as the ſaid <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were, who were oftentimes aſſaulted by their neighbours, and others of great force: and notwithſtanding they kept their city alwaies againſt all men, without making ditches or walles. It is then the vertue of the men that make a Towne principallie ſtrong, and inuincible, whilſt they haue victualls and where with all to defend themſelues. Furthermore I may ſay that it is hard to beſiege townes and places that are ſtrong by nature: for there is no man that would counſaile to beſiedge a Towne that were placed ſo high that it could not bee beaten with Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, nor bee approched vpon any ſide to be aſſaulted, without being in danger of them within: as are many Caſtles vppon rocks, which can neither be mined, for the hardnes of the rocks whervpon they are ſcituated, nor beaten becauſe of their height. The townes that are ſcituated in morie countries, or enuironed with ſea, although they bee not enuironed vpon all ſides, but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome one parte (ſo that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt be good) or with ſome large and deepe riuer, are likewiſe moſt ſtrong: and before them, a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall may looſe his time, if it be not a great hap: foraſmuch as it is not poſſible to approache them but at a meruelous diſaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Moreouer, it wilbe a great hap, if the beſiedged bee not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed often, as well with victualls as with men, in the diſpite of the beſiegers and they not knowing it, and ſuch are moſt of the Townes in <hi>Flaunders:</hi> in <hi>Italie</hi> there are many, as <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, Ferrare, Iſcle Gayette, Tarente,</hi> and others. Concerning the other Townes which are of the number of the moſt ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt in what place ſoeuer they are ſcituated, whether they be vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hills, or in plaines, we muſt thinke that they haue bin fortified
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:10495:131"/>
within this thirtie yeares: for thoſe which were before, may not bee termed to be ſtrong, ſith the ſkill to rampare is come to light but ſithens a ſhort time. Theſe then that haue beene ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared ſince that time, or in our time (which haue bin ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared by leaſure, and not in haſt) may be thought to be the moſt hardeſt to be conquered: before which there may be more loſt then wonne. But where is this Generall that woulde ſtay before <hi>Padua, Teroenne,</hi> and <hi>Turin,</hi> and many other Townes ſcituated in a plaine, or before <hi>Veconnie,</hi> or <hi>Beſſe,</hi> and others which are ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted high, except hee woulde depart thence with great ſhame. I thinke in my ſelfe that there is no man that would looſe his time ſo. But, not to ſpake of <hi>Italie</hi> onely we haue alſo many townes vpon the Frontires and within the Realme which may well be compared with the aboue ſaide. And as there is in <hi>Italie</hi> and <hi>Fraunce</hi> ſo there is in other places: and there wilbe more ere it be long, ſith euerie man is buſied with ramparing and making ſtrong townes, wherefore the conqueſt of a country from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth will be a moſt hard matter, I meane who ſo would plant himſelfe before euerie ſtrong towne, and where there is no hill or high place neare vnto them, from which a man may looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the towne, or beate ſome parte of it: for then it might not be thought to be ſtrong, except there were ſome remedy to be found againſt that anoyance. If the townes then againſt which a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall doeth pretend to proceede in armes, are prouided with greate number of people, or ſtrong by nature, or artificiallie as are thoſe I haue ſpoken of, he is not to meddle to beſiedge anie one of them, except it be farre off: or when as he ſhall be aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed that anie of them is ill furniſhed with victualls, or other prouiſion: or that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vſe of the water might be taken from them, in ſuch a cauſe he muſt not ſtay to plant a ſiedge: for that one of theſe neceſſities may ſuffice to conſtrayne the moſt ſtrongeſt towne in the world to render it ſelfe in ſhort time, likewiſe if the Souldiers be il paied, or if they be a ſmale number becauſe that fewe conſume in time: and that beeing ill paide they ſerue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their wills chiefely if they be ſtrangers, who do nothing but for profit, and not for the maintenance of their proper quarrell. Moreouer al townes are not ſo ſtrong, nor ſo wel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:10495:132"/>
that the manner of beſiedging before ſpoken of ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be vſed nor that regard had, and when as the ſaide Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall would beſieege anie towne as ſtrong as thoſe before ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of or any other of meane ſtrength, whatſoeuer ſhoulde hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen vnto him, the order that he ought to keepe therein muſt bee as here followeth. Let vs ſuppoſe that he is in the field with his fower Legions and their followers, going towards a place which he pretendeth to beſiedge: me thinke that his campe may marche in that forme that I haue ſpoken of heertofore: to weet euerie Legion with their part of the Ordnance, and other car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages: the firſt Legion making the auantgarde: the ſecond and the third the battaile: and the fourth the arriergard. The bagage appertayning vnto the fourth Legion may follow the third or at the taile of the forth, ſo that there be ſome horſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> behind them and one band of the forlorne hope. When the armie is vpon the way, the Lieutenant General ſhould ſend ſome trumpet before to ſummon them although it were a day or two before the armie can ariue before the ſaid towne, and after that the towne is ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned, when as the hoaſt is with in 3 or 4 miles of it, the ſaid Lieutenant Generall ſhall ſend the Captayne Generall of the horſemen before, &amp; the marſhall of the feild with him, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expreſſe man of iudgment, or go himſelfe in perſon, if he geue not credit ynough to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: to viewe the towne, &amp; to conſider of the ſcituation and ſtrength of it: and to ſee where it were beſt to place the campe. And to the intent that he that ſhould haue this charge might not be hindred by thoſe of the Garriſon to take a ſufficient view, he muſt be accompanied with ſome ſuch number of horſemen as might be thought to be ſtrong ynough to repulſe thoſe of the towne, when as they ſhould iſſue out.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer he muſt be furniſhed with ſo manie bandes of the forlone hope, as might bee thought ſufficient to ſuccour the horſemen, and to maintayne the ſkirmiſh vntill the Legions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuall: and for a need to enter into the towne, if they ſawe a fit occaſion, I meane if the Garriſon were not very ſtrong: and that theſe forerunners, were ſtronger then they. If ſo bee that the towne were ſcituated in ſuch a place, as it might bee vewed at eaſe, without danger of the ordnaunce, it might be done ſo

much the better: but if it were ſo ſcituated that it might be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached by no meanes vndiſcouered, when they are come neare the towne with in Cannon ſhot, the generall Chiefe that hath the charge muſt go on the one ſide, and muſt diſperſe his people ſome one way, &amp; ſome an other, to retyre vnto them if he were purſued: he might likewiſe cauſe ſome of his troops (ſkattering themſelues) to aproch neere vnto the town walles: and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe (with one or two at the moſt) might goe about the towne as neere as hee might with ſafetie, to the intent to view and conſider of the weakeneſſe, and ſtrength of the towne, as neere as he might coniecture: &amp; what part is eaſieſt to be bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, where hee might plant his ordaunce, and where the Campe ſhoulde be made. Whileſt this is a doing, it will bee a great maruaile if thoſe of the towne do not iſſue out vppon his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who ſo doing, it ſhal be neceſſarie for the aſſaulters to méete the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and to charge them with ſuch a fury, that they may driue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againe in at their gates, if it were poſſible: or at the leaſt beate them them well: and with howe much more valew they do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute this charge, ſo much the leſſe hurt they ſhall receiue of the ordnaunce in the towne, for that the towneſmen ſeing them to be mingled pell mell with their men, not knoweing wheere to beſtow a ſhot ſurely, ſhal be conſtrained to leaue their ſhooting, fearing to hurte their owne men aſſoone as their enemies. I ſaw the like by the Emperour his ſouldiers before <hi>Monople,</hi> when as the Marques of <hi>Gwaſt</hi> came to vewe it, who charged them ſo whoatly, his men being ſo mingled amongſt the light-horſe of the towne, that the ordnaunce nor harquebuſieres with in the towne, coulde not ſhoote without ſpoyling of their owne men, yet the meddle was almoſt at the edge of the ditch. I ſay therefore that this firſt charge being handled as it ought to be, may worke many great effects: as to diſmay the towneſ-men at their firſt ariuall, which is no ſmal matter. For this aſſault wil as much diſmay them if ſo be that they be beaten at the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, as it would embolden them if ſo be that they did reſiſt the aſſaliants, or haue the better hand of them. It is a thing of a maruailous conſequence, to handle the ſkirmiſh at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt ariual with courage: for it will make thoſe within the towne to think that it would be impoſſible to reſiſt a people of ſuch valour, and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:10495:133"/>
thereuppon will afterwards feare them in their heartes: for to ſay the truth, it is very ſtrange if the va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quiſhed do not feare him that hath once beaten him. Beſides this, it may perhaps be an occaſion of the taking of ſome of the chiefeſt of the towne priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or if it were but ſome of the ſimplieſt ſort, the eſtate of the towne may bee diſcouered by them: and if any of the chiefeſt were taken, the Generall ſhoulde prooue to corrupt them with mony, and to win them vnto him, and it might happen that the towne would be yeelded through his authoritie, or the affection that thoſe within do beare vnto him. And if it were ſo, that ſuch an one were taken by whoſe meanes the towne might bee got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, the Generall muſt helpe himſelfe with him, either by loue or force: by loue; that is in promiſing him many faire things in recompence, if ſo bee that hee will yeeld the towne ouer vnto him. And if by that means he can do nothing with him, he may threaten him with death, &amp; may aduertiſe thoſe within the towne what he pretendeth to do, if ſo be that they will not yeeld to ſaue his life, or that he himſelfe do not his indeuour to auoide it: and the ſaid Generall muſt cauſe the priſoner to bee brought in the ſight of the towne, neither to neare nor to farre from it, &amp; there make ſhew to put him to death, to moue the inhabitants with compaſſion, &amp; to make them the more afraid. Likewiſe his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may be vſed for an inſtrument to approache to the gates to aſſault them, for hardly will thoſe within ſhoot at him. Finally the furious handling of this firſt ſkirmiſh that I haue ſpoken of, might be an occaſion that the aſſaulters might be ſo mingled with the townſmen, that they might win the gates, &amp; enter pell mell with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: which is not ſo greatly to be maruailed at, becauſe of the preaſe &amp; troubles that happen in ſuch like actions, which oft times do fall out ſo great, that thoſe that are repulſed, haue not leaſure to reenter their place in good order; but do retire who beſt can faſteſt: ſo that if theſe townes haue not prouided for this inconuenience before hand, except that they doe ſhut their gates againſt their owne people, &amp; leaue them at the mercye of the aſſaulters: it is to bee thought, that if the ſaid aſſaulters do purſue them pel mell at their héeles, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the towne will be gotten at the inſtant, or at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaſt thoſe that are iſſued out will be taken priſoners. It is therfore a matter of no ſmall importance, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:10495:133"/>
at the firſt in the maner before ſpoken of, ſithe it may cauſe the war ſo ſoone to be ended. The aſſaulters muſt haue a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all regard vnto one thing if it ſhould come ſo to paſſe, that they ſhould enter into the towne pell mell with the defenders, that is to aſſure themſelues of the gates, &amp; to breake them off from the hinges if it were poſſible, or to let them from ſhutting by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great ſtones or timber in the way, &amp; alſo to impeach the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe of the pertcullis: for the townſmen may vſe a flight for a pollicie to intice the beſiegers into the towne, &amp; when as they do ſée that there are as many entred as they can well mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, they may let downe the pertcullis &amp; ſhut them in: therfore this muſt be taken héed of, &amp; a good garde ſet to kéepe the gates, and others appointed to win the gate houſe, which being woone muſt be kept as long as the townſmen do make reſiſtance. The reſt muſt follow the victory, who muſt execute it ſo diligentlye, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> garriſon nor others may haue leaſure to range the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in battaile in the market place, or elſewhere: for it is not to be thought that there are any beforehand to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thoſe places, for at this day we make no ſuch reckoning: for euery man aſſoone as they do heare that an enemie is in ſight, do run to the walles to behold them. I do not blame this diligence: but yet I doe not find it good that Souldiers ſhould abandon the place that they ought to kéepe, to run vnto any other: nor that the market places in a towne that is beſieged, or that dooth looke for a ſiege, ſhould be without me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of war at any time, but ſhould be alwaies garded with a good number: but theſe things haue carryed me a little from my matter. Wherefore to returne againe vnto the Captaine Generall of the Horſſemen, who after that he hath viewed all things well: ſpecially where the approches may be beſt made, muſt ſound a retreat &amp; returne againe vnto the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall: and the marſhall of the Campe muſt ſtay vpon the place where the armie ſhould lodge that night, which may be within cannon ſhot or nearer if it may be free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the danger of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. As for the forme of the Campe, I leaue it vnto the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the Marſhall, who muſt be ruled by the ſcituation of the place, and the greatneſſe of the towne.</p>
                     <p>Aboue all things hee muſt haue a care that the Legions doe not lye ſo diſioint the one from the other, nor ſo placed but that
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:10495:134"/>
they may eaſily ſuccour one another. And if there were any ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer that ſhould cauſe the armie to lye deuided, there muſt bee a bridge made ouer it, for them to paſſe and repaſſe the one vnto the other, which bridge muſt be fortified at both ends. Moreouer the armie being lodged, diſperſed, whether it bee to keepe the towne the more ſubiect, or to batter it in diuers places, euerye part muſt be ſo well fortified &amp; rampared, that their forts might not be entred, what endeuour or force the Townſmen or others might vſe. Likewiſe it were neceſſarie, that euery fort ſhould haue in it twiſe as much people as the garriſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> towne, except the ſcituation did helpe them greatly. One Legion may lodge alone, ſo that it were lodged in a ſtrong place, although that the garriſon of the towne were as ſtrong as it. And when as there are eight or ten thouſand men of warre in a towne, two Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons might be lodged together: and kéepe the ſiege in two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, making a trench from the one to the other, placing certaine ſmall forts betwixt the two Campes, to hinder thoſe of the Towne from ouer-running thoſe that ſhould paſſe too and fro betwixt them And as there muſt a care be had to defend the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie from the towne, ſo muſt the like care alſo be had of the hurt that it may receiue of the countrie. And if ſo be that the legions do lodge ſeuerall by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, their fort muſt haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forme that I haue giuen it in the firſt booke, in lodging of one legion alone. And when as the Horſſemen might not bee lodged with them conuenientlye, or that the place were not large enough to laye out the quarters at length, the Marſhall of the campe may take out the Horſſemen and laye them further off from the Towne, prouided that hee doe lodge them in ſome ſtrong place: for in truthe the nature of Horſmen in the ſiege of a towne, is to bee lodged ſomewhat farre off, for to reſiſt the courſes of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies comming from other townes and garriſons neare. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the allarmes which the beſieged may giue, their footme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doe iſſue foorth &amp; not their Horſmen, except that they haue ſome gate frée, or that the beſiegers do lie far off. If the Horſmen doe lodge a part, it ſhall bee neceſſary that the Campe ſhould be ſo much leſſened as the roome y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Horſmen did occupie, &amp; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it ſhould be ſquare if they were all lodged together, and had place enough, it muſt be lodged as the ſcituation &amp; the ſiege will
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:10495:134"/>
permit. And in this point only the Campe muſt be ſubiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſcituation, becauſe that Townes are diuerſly placed, according vnto whoſe ſcituation, the beſiegers muſt be lodged, and not after the manner that they would. That is héere ſpoken of the diſioynt, lodging, or deuiding of the army, may be vſed at the Generall his pleaſure. But for the fyrſt day of the army his arriuall before the Towne, the Campe may haue the accuſtomed forme: and afterward the night follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing, or when the Generall doth thinke it conuenient, he may deuide his people at his will: but as ſoone as the ſaid Generall doth arriue with hys armye, he ought to ſend one that is a man well ſpoken to ſummon it, who in executing this charge, muſt ſéeke by all meanes to haue conference with the Chiefes as is before ſaide: and the Towne béeing ſummoned, the Generall the night following muſt cauſe the approaches to be made in as many places as he doth pretende to batter it, and giue or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what people ſhould lodge on the one ſide of the Towne, and what vppon the other. Likewiſe what Chiefes ſhould haue the charges of the ſayde ſieges, and what quantitie of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſhould be neceſſary in euery part. I do not counſaile hym to plant all hys Ordnance towards the Towne, but to haue a regard to place ſome of the ſmalleſt to beate the wayes, ſpecially if he do doubt to be aſſaulted towarde the countrey. Neither would I counſayle hym to deuide and diſpearſe hys Campe too much, if he did doubt any puiſſant enemy that were of ſufficient ſtrength to keepe him waking from time to time. But it is before preſuppoſed, that his enemies haue no ſtrength in the field, but only that there are certaine obſtinate Townes neere, whoſe garriſons might make ſuddaine courſes, which to impeach, there may be diuers bands of horſſemen lodged in ſtrong places neare vnto them, who might both conuoy the victuallers in paſſing and repaſſing, and keepe the way free from theeues, and other naughtie people which do common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye followe a Campe to ſpoyle commers and goers: but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto the ſiege. Before that the Ordnance ſhoulde bée brought néere vnto the Towne, the Mayſter of the ſame ſhould be furniſhed with good ſtore of Gabbions, cauſing them
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:10495:135"/>
to be rouled by his Pyoners vnto the place where the Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſhould be placed. And this worke ſhould be put in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe when as the Moone ſhineth not, but when the nightes are darke. Alſo the Ordnance muſt be brought vnto the batterie with as little noyſe as may be, to the intent not to be diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto thoſe of the Towne, who might ſhoote at them. And to collour theyr buſines the better, there may be a great noyſe made in the Campe with Drummes, Trompets, and other thynges, whileſt that the Carters doe theyr indeuour. Part of the Forlorne hope muſt bée placed hard vnto the Towne-gates, who muſt lye flatte vppon theyr bellyes, readie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue thoſe that might iſſue out: and part muſt occupye Spade and Pickaxe with the Pyoners, to bring the tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches as néere vnto the ditch ſide as they may, and fill thoſe Gabbions with earth that are appointed to couer the Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and the places of the trenches that are ſubiect vnto the ſhotte of the Towne, which muſt be done with ſo great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, that the daye doo not ſurpriſe them before that they haue made the ſayde Trenches, and filled the Gabbions, for béeyng vncouered, they wyll ſerue the defenders for a marke to ſhoote at: for my meaning is that the Forlorne hope ſhoulde be appoynted to gard the Trenches, and if they were not thought ſtrong ynough for thoſe of the Garriſon, the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyers that ſerue for the flankes may bée put vnto them. Which doing, the Forlorne hope, and thoſe of the flankes of two Legions will make 3432. men, which is a ſufficient number to reſiſt a ſtrong Garriſon as I do thinke, and they may bée augmented, or refreſhed with the other bands, if it ſhall pleaſe the Generall to appoint them to be in the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches by turnes, and this gard muſt be placed by the Ordnance for to defende it at all tymes. The ſame night that the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall hath deuided hys armye, he might make a proffer to aſſault it before that the Ordnance beginne to batter, and if he would ſkale it with ladders, the ditches béeing full of water, which could not immediatly be drawne drye, or filled, he muſt prepare Bridges expreſſely to paſſe the water; and lay Timber from the Bridges to the Gates of the Towne. And
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:10495:135"/>
if he would put this in execution, it muſt be done a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore daye, or at midnight when as the defenders are moſt heauyeſt aſléepe: but being done in a darke night, the aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters muſt haue ſome token or cogniſance amongſt them, as ſome word, or garments of like collour. We do at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vſe ſhyrts drawne ouer our garments.</p>
                     <p>If this counſaile of aſſaulting do not like the Generall, the Maiſter of the Ordnance muſt ſalute the Towne in the daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the day with Cannon ſhot, and muſt haſten the batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie as much as poſſibly he may, for there is no better way to haue hys will of thoſe that are within the Towne, if the wall be weake, then to continue the batterie the firſt day with great diligence, vntill ſuch time as the breach be of reaſonable breadth, and although it be not of great breadth, ſo that the defences bée taken away, it may be aſſaulted, without giuing the defenders leiſure to rampare, or to make any Trench a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it whileſt the batterie doth continue, the ſtones and clods that flye from the breach hindering them from doing it. Moreouer, they will be ſo diſmayed with the ſuddaine arriuall of the armye, and ſpeedie handling of the batterie (except that they be hardned, and accuſtomed to ſee a batterie) that it will be verie hard but they will be vanquiſhed at the firſt aſſaulte.</p>
                     <p>Further, at that inſtant that the aſſault is giuen, the Towne may be ſkaled with ladders on euerie ſide, which will put the defenders in great feare to be loſt, how little ſo euer any part is entred by their enemy, or abandoned by the defenders. Or there néedeth but one amongſt them to cry that their enemyes are entred at ſome part for to aſtoniſh all the reſt, and to cauſe them to quitte the places that they ought to defende. The aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulters muſt vſe all their endeuour for to enter at the firſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, reſolutely aſſuring themſelues to do it to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: for if ſo be that they ſhould be reſiſted or repulſed, the defenders would be incouraged, and the aſſaulters diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, ſo that afterward there would be much ado to vanquiſhe them, and to bring the beſiegers againe vnto the aſſault, but greatly againſt their willes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="244" facs="tcp:10495:136"/>If the Generall do thinke it good to deferre the aſſault vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till that the breache be wyde and large he may do it: but then thoſe of the towne hauing leiſure, will fortifye againſt him, ſo that it will be hard to enter, for that the inuentions are ſo great that are vſed at this day in the defending of a towne, that the firſt aſſaulters (except it be a great maruell) may accoumpt themſelues to be ſpoiled and murdered, as ſoone as they do ſet forward to goe to a breach, for that it is almoſt impoſſible that they ſhould eſcape without death: yet notwithſtanding the cuſtome is to ſend formoſt the moſt experteſt and valianteſt men of all the army, who ſerue for no other purpoſe but to receiue vppon their perſons all the miſchiefes that an enemy hath ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyed to inuent, and prepared in long time before. Moreouer, when as theſe firſt valiant men are ſlaine, it is not ſéene that thoſe that did follow them do long abide the place, or that they do any endeuour to reuenge the death of their Chiefes, or to goe forward, but are ſo ſkared with the loſſe of them, that they haue neither heart nor will to do well, ſo that the beſt and firſt being loſt, the reſt will do nothing ought woorth. I would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme my ſayings to be true by the aſſault that was giuen at the Caſtell of <hi>Hedin,</hi> in the King his preſence, my Lord the <hi>Doulphine,</hi> and in the preſence of the greateſt part of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Lords of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> if I thought that many of thoſe that were there, appointed for to aſſault, would not thinke euill of me, who ought to haue béene incouraged by the forwardnes of many Lords, Captaynes, and other valiant men, which ſhewed them the way to aboord their enemyes: notwithſtanding they were ſo ſkared with the ſlaughter of thoſe that went formoſt, that there was none of them afterward that would once ſturre afoote: indeede I would alleadge this for an authoritie, but that I ſhould haue ill will for it, and therefore I will holde my peace, for becauſe that the Countie <hi>Danſerne,</hi> Captaine <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencourt</hi> his brother, and certayne others, were ſlayne and hurt lyke men of vertue, the reſt would not fight, but retired quickly enough.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> do make a better accoumpt in preſeruing of their Ianiſſaries, and other valiant men in their armyes, for theyr
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:10495:138"/>
Aſaſpes are appointed firſt of all to aſſault, who are a certaine kinde of ſouldiers that are made little accoumpt of, and do ſerue but only to diſcouer and endeuor all the inuentions that defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders can deuiſe: ſo that when as the ſaid Aſaſpes are repulſed, the Ianiſſaries néede to feare nothing but handſtroakes, for that the murthers, the traines, firepots, firepicks, poddings, fagots, and all other fireworks do make, haue playde theyr partes: beſides the Galtrappes, tables with nailes, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other miſchiefes, are couered with ſlaine and maimed men before that they do come vnto the breach, and their trenches are couered ouer head, ſo that they do but only fight againſt men, and are ſo good men that there can be no better, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is almoſt impoſſible that the defenders ſhould reſiſt them. If the King in theſe like caſes would be ſerued with thoſe that are in priſons, and haue deſerued death, cauſing them to be ſafely kept in following the army, and hazard them at the firſt point of the aſſaults that might be giuen, deuiding them ſo that they might ſerue for many times, he ſhould not léeſe ſo many good men as he doth, and by that meanes it would be a hard matter to repulſe his men at any time as they are repulſed: for the ſayd priſoners ſhould be the firſt that ſhould abyde the miſchiefe that the defenders had prepared: which priſoners ſhould do nothing but carry boords, planks, and make bridges ouer the ditches, and returne, and then the ſouldyers béeing alwayes at their heeles in a readynes, might enter, and by that meanes they ſhould be frée of the daunger which the firſt aſſaulters are ſubiect vnto, for that the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders will haue ſpued out all their venome vppon them firſt, ſo that there is nothing to be doubted before the comming to handſtroakes, but certaine harquebuſſe ſhot. And to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that theſe condemned priſoners ſhould the more willingly aduenture themſelues vnto this manyfeſt death, all thoſe muſt be promiſed to be pardoned that do their endeuors well, who ſhould by and by be quitted of all their offence. Beſides, if any of them were hurt, the Marſhall of the Campe ſhould cauſe them to be prouided for. Who ſo ſhould demaund to knowe what bands the Generall ſhould vſe in theſe aſſaults, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:10495:139"/>
it ſhould be to enter a breache, or to ſkale a bullwarke, or wall: I would aunſwere, that although this queſtion touch the ordinarie bands of the Legions, yet he ought firſt of all to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point certayne troupes of Pikemen of the Forlorne hope, and as many of thoſe of the flanks. As for the Harquebuſiers, they muſt be in the trenches, all alongſt the edge of the ditch, to ſhoote at the defenders when as they doe ſhewe themſelues. Let vs ſuppoſe that there is but one breach. When the Generall hath cauſed all things to be done, and is readie to aſſault, the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and <hi>Triaries</hi> of the firſt and ſecond Legion ſhould be ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together, and raunged in one ſquare Battailon of 50. ranks, euery ranke hauing 85. men: and the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Triaries</hi> of the third and fourth Legion ſhould be raunged together in like manner, and in ſome place very néere vnto the towne, and not ſubiect vnto the Ordnance: and if the place be not couered ynough from the ſayd Ordnance, they muſt lye downe vppon the ground on their bellies, attending in that order vntill that the Generall be readie to vſe them. As for the <hi>Haſtaries,</hi> they muſt be deuided into foure troupes, and muſt take off thoſe pieces off from their harneſſe, that might hinder them from mounting lightly and nimbly at a breache: and when as the Trumpets and Drummes do ſound to aſſault, the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> of the foure Legions muſt aſſault one after another, the fourth Legion firſt, and the Forlorne hope of the fourth Legion muſt ſkale it with ladders: and if that they were not a number great ynough, the Forlorne hope of the third Legion ſhould be at hand to helpe them. The <hi>Haſtaries</hi> might haue theyr choiſe to vſe theyr Pikes or their Targets. If they did make choiſe of the Pike, they might throwe downe their Targets in the breache to fill it, to ſaue their féete from Galtrappes and ſuch like. If their Targets did like them beſt, they might make a bridge with their Pikes if néede were: and muſt fight vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly as long as they may ſtande: and if they were victorious they ſhould enter the Towne, and if the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> of the fourth Legion were not ynough, the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> of the third Legion ſhould followe them when as the Generall did make ſigne, and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:10495:139"/>
after them the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> of the other Legions. Thoſe which do enter firſt, and thoſe of the third Legion, muſt execute the victorie, and the reſt muſt goe directly vnto the Market pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and vnto the other great places within the Towne, and raunge themſelues in Battaile in them, to kéepe them vntill ſuch time as there were no more reſiſtance made. The <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and <hi>Triaries</hi> muſt not ſturre from their places, except that they were commaunded. But if ſo be that the aforeſaid <hi>Haſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> who firſt aſſaulted ſhould be repulſed, it toucheth them of the third Legion to aſſault after them, and then thoſe of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde, and thoſe of the firſt after them. And if ſo be that all theſe <hi>Haſtaries</hi> ſhould be repulſed, the <hi>Princes</hi> muſt aſſault after them, euery Legion in his turne, beginning with the fourth, and ending with the firſt. And if the <hi>Princes</hi> could do nothing, the <hi>Triaries</hi> muſt haue their turnes one after another: and by this meanes the defenders ſhould be troubled with one aſſault vppon another, and not haue leiſure to take breathe: and in ſo doing, I do not blame the defenders if they can not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande twelue aſſaults, one béeing giuen preſently after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by good ſouldyers and freſhe men, ſpecially in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Generall of the army, the Captayne Generall of the footemen, and the Colonels who béeing neere aſſiſtants, will iudge of euery mans valor. As for the ſending of the horſſemen when all theſe haue fayled, I knowe not what to ſay, but the proofe will coſt nothing. Which ſaide horſſemen vppon the dayes of batteries and aſſaultes, ought to garde that ſide of the Campe next the Countrey, to withſtande the inconuenience that might happen on that ſide, ſpecially if there were any enemyes neere, who might aſſault any quarter of the Campe to hinder the aſſault of the Towne, at whiche tyme alſo the Campe might be troubled to make reſiſtance vnto thoſe of the Towne, who might ſally out at the ſame inſtant.</p>
                     <p>I haue ſayde before, that the Generall ſhould appoynte the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Triaries</hi> of two Legions to be raunged in one whole Batailion together, and thoſe of the other
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:10495:140"/>
two together, as néere vnto the towne as they might, to be imployed when it ſhould be néedefull, who ſhould ſerue for no other purpoſe, but to make reſiſtance vnto thoſe of the towne if ſo be that they did ſally foorth whileſt the aſſault did continue: and when as the Generall ſhould take the <hi>Princes</hi> from one of his Batailons to ſend them vnto the aſſault, it is méete that the <hi>Haſtaries</hi> ſhould be put in their places, and by this meanes the Batailons might be reenforced, and not diminiſhed. I muſt not héere forget a pollicy that was vſed before <hi>Golette</hi> in <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery,</hi> by the Emperour his Gunners, at that inſtant that the Chriſtians were readie to giue the aſſault: that was for to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moores</hi> that were within, and to make them to belieue that the aſſaulters did continue in their tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches (for it is a generall rule that the battery muſt ceaſſe when the aſſaulters are néere the breach) the ſaid Gunners conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued their ſhooting, vntill ſuch time as the ſaid Chriſtians had aborded them in their fort: and becauſe the Ordnance ſhould do no hurt amongſt their men, they did put in wadds of hay in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtead of ſhot: wherein the infidels were deceiued, for that they attended vppon the Ordnance which ceaſed not: wherefore when as they ſawe the Chriſtians at handſtroakes with them, before that they did looke for them, it did diſmay and trouble them, and cauſed them to breake. In that manner before ſpoken of may the Legions be deuided for to goe vnto the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, the firſt day that the Ordnance doth beate, or at any other time: and if the Generall do knowe any great difficultie to winne it by batterie onely, he may put the myne in practiſe alſo, if it may be myned: which myne may be vſed to enter into the towne withall, and pierſed through: or may be vſed to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe the walles and other defences through the violence of the powder that muſt be put into it, which powder muſt not be fiered, before the Generall ſée his time conuenient to giue order to aſſault it. The Generall ſhould alſo enquire, and cauſe it to be diligently ſearched, if there were no vault, or watercourſe that iſſued into the ditches, for they might be very neceſſarie helps to get a Towne by. <hi>Naples</hi> was taken by <hi>Belli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarius,</hi> in the yeare 538. by meanes of a conduct of water.
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:10495:136"/>
It was likewiſe taken in the ſelfe-ſame place by King <hi>Remus</hi> in the yeare 1463. <hi>Monople</hi> was taken by the Marques of <hi>Guaſt,</hi> by meanes of an old caue that lay buried vnder ground. Moreouer, it would not be amiſſe to offer many ſkirmiſhes, and to ſeeke by all meanes poſſible to drawe the defenders out of their fort, to the intent to diminiſh and waſte their people. And if it were ſo that the plague were in the countrie, there might be commaundement giuen to recouer ſome of the garments or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things that the infected did vſe, or the perſons infected might be brought, ſo that there were héed taken for bringing the infection amongſt his men in ſtead of ſending it amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt others. And hauing recouered theſe things, or the perſons infected, they ſhould bee layd in ſuch places whereas they might fall into his enemies hands, that by that meanes they might haue the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to come amongſt them. This meanes vſed the Lord <hi>Rance</hi> againſt vs to infect our Campe, when he was in <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone.</hi> Furthermore, if the Generall did hope to vanquiſh them by famine, he ought to haue a care that no victuall ſhould enter. If the towne he beſieged were ſcituated neere the Sea, it were neceſſarie that he ſhould be maiſter of the Sea: or elſe it will be victualled and refreſhed of all things in deſpite of him. And if it haue any great riuer neere, he muſt keepe good watch that no victuall do enter by it: and not only for boates, but for all other things that the water may driue alongſt. For the <hi>Romanes</hi> maintained many daies the garriſon of <hi>Caſſelin,</hi> by meanes of barrels full of corne and nuttes which they caſt into the riuer that paſſed by their walles, which were afterwards taken vp by thoſe of the towne, <hi>Anniball</hi> not knowing of it in long time. There are meanes alſo to be vſed for the famiſhing of a towne, which do well ſerue in this place. <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> deſtroyed all the corne of the <hi>Campenois,</hi> inſomuch that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing gathered in all the whole ſommer ſeaſon: and when the ſeede time came, he went farre of and forſooke them, becauſe that he would not hinder them from ſowing again: hoping that they would vnfurniſh themſelues of a great part of their graine, which they did: wherevpon the ſayd <hi>Fabius</hi> returned againe afterwards &amp; deſtroyed all that was growne vpon the ground:
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:10495:137"/>
who finding themſelues vnfurniſhed of victuals, were conſtray<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned to yeeld vnto his mercie. After that he conquered many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther townes, and deſiring that a towne called <hi>Rhege,</hi> ſomtimes ſcituated in <hi>Calabria,</hi> and now deſtroyed, fayned himſelfe to bee a friend vnto the townes men: and vnder colour of friendſhip he required victuals for to maintaine his armie, which being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto him for his monie, he liued a certaine time with their victualls: and afterwards, when he knewe that their victualls went lowe, he then declared himſelfe to bee their enemie, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercame them.</p>
                     <p>By this meanes <hi>Alexander</hi> would haue taken <hi>Leucadie,</hi> which abounded with all things: who before he approached vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, taking all the townes and ſtrong places round about it, ſuffered the garriſons of the ſayd places and all others to retire vnto <hi>Leucadie,</hi> to the intent that the great multitude of people that retired thether ſhould famiſh the towne the ſooner. <hi>Phalaris</hi> hauing had warres with certaine knights of <hi>Sicil,</hi> fayning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to bee friends with them, gaue them certaine corne of his to keepe, which was (as he ſayd) remayning: which corne he put into certaine Garners within their towne, cauſing ſecrete holes to be made in the roofes of the ſayd Garners, whereby the rayne running into the corne might corrupt it: vpon the truſt of which corne, the inhabitants ſould their owne corne ſo much the better cheape: but being beſieged the yeare following, finding the corne that the ſayd <hi>Phalaris</hi> had giuen them to keepe to bee corrupted, &amp; their owne ſpent, he forced the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to do what he would.</p>
                     <p>With theſe policies the aforeſayd Generall might helpe him ſelfe, if they might fall out for his purpoſe: and on the other part if he would make the beſieged beleeue that he would not ſtirre from before their towne vntill he had his pretence; he might imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the examples following: as <hi>Clearchus</hi> the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> who being aduertiſed that the <hi>Thracians</hi> were retired vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mountaines, hauing carried with them all things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for their ſuſtentation, and that they hoped to bee deliuered from him by meanes of the famine which would conſtraine him to go his waies: he commaunded that at the comming of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Ambaſſadours vnto him in the behalfe of the <hi>Thracians,</hi>
                        <pb n="251" facs="tcp:10495:137"/>
that ſome one of his <hi>Thracian</hi> priſoners ſhould bee publikely ſlaine, and that afterward he ſhould be cut in ſmall peeces: which being done, he ſent theſe peeces into diuers quarters of his Campe in the ſight of the ſayd Ambaſſadours, making ſhewe that it was the victuall wherewith he fed his Campe: which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanitie being reported vnto the ſayd <hi>Thracians,</hi> made them ſo afrayd, that they yeelded ſooner then they would haue done, imagining that the ſayd <hi>Clearchus</hi> ſought by all meanes poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to keepe himſelfe long time in the countrie, ſeeing that he fed his men with ſo execrable a meate.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tyberius Gracchus</hi> hauing warres with the <hi>Portugalles,</hi> beſieging a certaine towne of theirs, which vaunted that they were ſufficiently victualled for ten yeares: he aunſwered them, that he would haue them the eleuenth yeare; wherewith they were ſo diſmayed, that they came to compoſition with him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly. An enemie may alſo be perſwaded that a ſiege ſhould continue long, by building of houſes, and lodgings, which may hold out winter and ſommer, and by making of great prouiſion of victualls, and building of Milles and Ouens, to grinde corne and bake bread. The Generall muſt ſeeke by al meanes poſſible to make the beſieged afrayd, and helpe himſelfe with all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties that might ſerue his turne: ſpecially with the ſame that <hi>Phillip</hi> vſed againſt a Caſtle which he could not take by force, who cauſed a great quantitie of earth to be brought vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> edge of their ditch by night, making ſhewe that he mined: for which cauſe thoſe of the Garriſon fearing that their place would bée pearced through in ſhort time by the mine, yéelded themſelues incontinent. <hi>Pelopidas</hi> beſieging two townes that ſtood neere together; being before the one, commanded ſecretly that foure of his knights ſhould come vnto him, out of the other ſiege with the greateſt ioy that they might poſſible, and crowned as it was the manner of thoſe that did bring any good newes: and had giuen order that a wood that was betwixt both the townes ſhould bee ſet on fire, to the intent to make them beléeue that it was their neighbours towne that burnt. And moreouer, hee cauſed certaine of his owne men to bee apparelled and led like priſoners néere vnto the towne ſide that hee beſieged:
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:10495:138"/>
wherefore the inhabitants thinking that the other aforeſayd towne was taken, doubting that the like miſerie would happen vnto them, if they did not yeeld, gaue themſelues ouer incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent vnto <hi>Pelopidas:</hi> who knewe that the other would do no leſſe when as it ſawe it ſelfe to be left alone.</p>
                     <p>A Generall may likewiſe cauſe a towne to bee aſſaulted on that ſide that it doth leaſt doubt an aſſault: beginning firſt to aſſault it on that parte that they doe keepe greateſt watch. He might alſſo practiſe to intice them into the fielde, if that there were no other way to vanquiſh them: and do as many good Chiefs haue done in times paſt: amongſt who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                        <hi>Lucius Scipio</hi> in <hi>Sardaigne,</hi> hauing beſieged a moſt ſtrong towne, appoynted at a certaine time during the aſſiege, that his men ſhould make ſhewe to mutin, and to bee in armes one againſt another, for which mutins ſake he fayned ſodainly to flye and all his in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order: which being perceiued by the townes men, they iſſued out at their heeles with a great power, and went ſo farre after them from their towne, that a certaine ambuſh which the ſayd <hi>Scipio</hi> had layd neere vnto the towne, had time enough to aſſault and take it, for that there was not one ſoule that did defend it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anniball</hi> being before a great towne, placed a good number of his Souldiers in ambuſh néere vnto the ſayd towne, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing inticed the citizens out with a ſkirmiſh, making ſhewe that he was not in ſafetie for them in his Campe, he abandoned it, ſuffering them to take it: the townes men thinking that all was wonne, ſeazed vpon his Campe, beſides thoſe that were left within iſſued out both great and ſmall, thinking to haue their part of the pillage: but when as they thought that they had woon all, they loſt al: becauſe that thoſe that were in the ambuſh thruſt themſelues into their towne and tooke it eaſely, for that there was no bodie in it to defend it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Himilco</hi> likewiſe placed an ambuſh by night neere vnto a towne which he beſieged called <hi>Agrigentum,</hi> commaunding them that when as he had inticed the townes men out, &amp; drawne them farre of, that they ſhould ſet certaine wood and other things on fire, and iſſue out of their ambuſh: and when the day came, he offered them of the towne ſkirmiſh, who iſſuing out vpon him,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:10495:140" rendition="simple:additions"/>
chaſed him farre of, for he would haue it to bee ſo. Wherevpon the ambuſh put fire vnto the wood, the ſmoake whereof was ſo great, that the <hi>Agregentins</hi> thinking that it was their towne that was ſet on fire by ſome miſhappe, returned to ſaue their towne who beſt might faſteſt: wherevpon the ambuſh preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelues before them, and <hi>Himilco</hi> following them neere, they got the townes men betwixt them, and ouerthrewe them.</p>
                     <p>The Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> vſed once this policie againſt the line of <hi>Beniamin.</hi> To make ſhort, if all theſe ſubtilties can bring foorth no fruite, the Generall may aſſay to ouercome them by making ſhewe to leaue them quite, remoouing his hoaſt: for in ſo doing, perhappes the townes men will thinke themſelues ſo ſure, that they will keepe but little watch or none at all: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the ſayd Generall may returne with all ſpeede to aſſault them, trauailing as much ground in one night as he did before in foure daies. I had forgotten to tell, that in pretending to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege one towne, a Generall may make ſhew to beſiege another: to the intent that the towne that doth doubt nothing, might vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furniſh it ſelfe of garriſon for to helpe the other: wherevpon that may be left which is furniſhed, &amp; the other beſieged that is vnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: as the Lord of <hi>Lautrec</hi> did when as he approached néere vnto <hi>Milan,</hi> who fayned that he cared not for <hi>Pauie,</hi> (although it was the towne that he ſought) for after that he was aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that the Countie of <hi>Belleioyenſe</hi> had ſent part of his people vnto the ſuccour of <hi>Milan,</hi> and thereby to haue diſarmed <hi>Pauie</hi> which he ought to haue better furniſhed and armed: the ſaid Lord of <hi>Lautrec</hi> placed his ſiege before <hi>Pauie,</hi> &amp; tooke it eaſie enough. But for to get out of this matter, leauing all theſe ſubtilties a part, I ſay that a Lieutenant Generall ought neuer to keepe the field, nor an aſſiege ſo long as winter laſteth: for it will be a great chaunge if it do not happen ill in the ende: for that a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſiege waſteth, and conſumeth an armie; whereas thoſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a towne are well lodged, and do take no more care then they neede. Moreouer, the beſiegers are at the mercie of the colde, ſnowes, raines, and a thouſand other perſecutions: ſo that there néedeth no other enemie but the wether it ſelfe to ouerthrowe
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:10495:141" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them, if the ſiege do continue any time: beſides, in winter victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als can hardly be brought vnto a Campe for the difficultie of the waies, &amp; waters, if ſo bée it ſhould come by land: and if it ſhould come by ſea, the tempeſtes and outrages which are more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the winter then at any other time, would hinder the bringing of it: ſo that we muſt conclude, that all things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for the maintenance of a ſiege, will then fall out ill for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers. Winter therfore is a moſt daungerous ſeaſon for thoſe that do keepe the Campe, and of moſt aduantage for thoſe that are beſieged: ſo that if they bee ſtrong, and can tarrie for a time conuenient, they may raiſe the ſiege and ouerthrowe all, or at the leaſt giue the beſiegers ſome ſcourges. Alſo the Garriſons of the other townes and forts that are in the countrie may be in ſhort time aſſembled, to charge the ſayd Campe, of whome (in mine opinion) they might haue as good a market as they would wiſh: foraſmuch as the ſayd Garriſons are freſh and reſted men, and the others are pined and halfe dead with famine. The like may happen vnto thoſe that do keepe the fielde, or do martch from place to place in an enemie his countrie in the winter: for that ill wether will conſume them in ſhort time, if ſo be that they lodge without doores: and for to lodge them couered, they ſhall be forced to ſeperate themſelues in villages here and there: and being aſſaulted when as they are ſo lodged, they may bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne eaſely. In fine, the beſt way for a Generall is to retyre his men into townes, when as winter doth come, and to go into the field about the laſt of March, and to keepe the field vntill the laſt of October: &amp; the countries might be ſuch where the wars ſhould be made, that the moneths of Iuly and Auguſt would be aſmuch to be feared, by reaſon of the extreame heate that it doth make in ſome regions, as the moſt coldeſt winter that might be: for theſe two extremities are not to be indured: for either of them may be cauſes of many great ſickneſſes and euills, who ſo doth not prouide for it. Wherefore, the Generall muſt haue a care to ende his warres before winter. And being conſtrayned to keepe his armie in the field in a very hote countrie, he muſt alwaies plant his Camp in ſuch places, where it might be couered with trees, and watred with ſprings, to refreſh his Souldiers. And
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:10495:141"/>
moreouer, lodge them houſed, if it were poſſible, to keepe them from the heate. But this matter hath laſted long enough, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for that mens wittes at theſe daies are ſo quicke, that they do prouide of themſelues for al things that are neceſſarie in ſuch like caſes. I do but only ſay, that if the Generall do get a towne by compoſition, that he ought to keepe all the articles that haue béen agreed vpon betwixt him &amp; thoſe of the towne from poynt to poynt: for in doing otherwiſe, he ſhould neuer finde towne or man that would giue him credit, or truſt his promiſe afterward, but they would do all that they could imagine before that they would fall into his hands. As I do ſay he ought to keepe his promiſe vnto thoſe of a towne that doth yeeld: ſo meane I that he ſhould keepe it vnto all others after that he hath once paſſed his word, vſing towards all thoſe that he doth conquer, as great lenitie and méekenes as he may poſſible, and aboue all things to eſchue crueltie: becauſe that the true office of a conquerour is to pardon and to haue pitie vpon the conquered: yet reaſon would that this pardoning ſhould be done with aduiſe, leaſt he do giue them an occaſion to begin the warres againe at their owne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites. For oftentimes the clemencie of Captaine Generalles of hoaſts is ſo great, that they do pardon all thoſe whome they do conquer, and all thoſe that haue offended: which facilitie in pardoning, doth cauſe them ofttimes to commit newe offences: for that they doe looke to bee receiued whenſoeuer they ſhould yéeld.</p>
                     <p>In ſuch caſes me think there ought a meane to be vſed, &amp; ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſome one ought to bee chaſtened, to make others to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayd: ſpecially thoſe which do reuolt without cauſe. I doe ſay moreouer, that they ought likewiſe to bee chaſtened that are ſo foole hardie, that they dare defend a place which is not defence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able (and but a doue houſe) hoping to be receiued vnto mercie at all times: cauſing vpon this hope a great quantitie of prouiſion to bee ſpent, and an armie to ſpend time for a thing of no value. I ſay that ſuch ought to be vſed ſomewhat rigorouſly, &amp; ſo wee do reaſonablie well at this day: for their leaſt puniſhment is to bee married vnto the Gallies for euer: yet ſome doe vſe it more gratiouſly then others, of whome the Countie of <hi>Tende</hi> is one,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:10495:142"/>
who might haue vſed priſoners more rigorouſly then he did: but it is not ſayd that faults ſhould bee alwaies puniſhed according vnto their deſerts: ſpecially if he that hath fayled bee otherwiſe a man of vertue: nor likewiſe that great harts ſhould not ſhewe their greatnes many waies, ſpecially to pardon a fault that tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth them perticularly: as the ſayd Countie did the offence of a certaine Captaine, which he tooke in one of his fortreſſes in <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> whome he vſed alwaies ſo courteouſly, that the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of that clemencie ought not to bee forgotten: and for that cauſe I haue inferred it in this place. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crueltie that a Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Generall ought to flie, is after the winning of a battaile, or after the taking of a towne by force. For what can bee more diſagreeing from man his nature, then after the treading of an enemie his Enſignes vnder feete, ſacking their Campe, diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, in putting them to fight, and cutting their battailes in peeces in the furie, to ſlay them in a cold moode that were not ſlaine in the battaile: or after that a breach is forced, and thoſe ſlaine that ſtood in the defence of their towne, then to kill al thoſe that do yéeld? and the poore inhabitants both old and young, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that they are diſarmed and innocent? And moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, to ſuffer wiues and maydens to be rauiſhed, and ſometimes ſlaine, their Churches pillaged, and their ſacred things conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into vild vſes? In truth it is more then crueltie. The Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall therefore ought to haue a great care of thoſe diſorders, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding his people to exerciſe the like cruelties, but only while the battaile continueth, and there ſhould be thoſe amongſt them that ſhould forbid it. Moreouer, if he would that the people of a towne ſhould make the leſſe reſiſtance, after that they are forced to quite a breach, &amp; not conſtraine them to fight and to ſell their liues deare, as people out of hope for want of a place to retyre vnto: he ſhould cauſe one of the towne gates to bee ſet open to giue them paſſage, and proclamation to be made that his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ſhould not charge them that did not reſiſt, nor hurt thoſe that layd downe their armes. For to be briefe, if a Generall will bee well ſpoken of both by his friends and his enemies, and bee beloued of all men; he muſt after a victorie cauſe the hurt men of both parts to bee prouided for as carefully, as if they were his
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:10495:142"/>
méere kinſmen. Furthermore it is requiſite that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence his men, that did their endeuours well: or at the leaſt that he ſhould commend them publikely, and aduertiſe the king of their vertue, attributing vnto euerye man his deſarts: and not vnto himſelfe as many doe, that ſpeaking nothing of that theyr Souldiers haue doone, but giue the praiſe vnto themſelues. And finally hee muſt vſe himſelfe ſo towardes all men, that it might not bee thought that hee made warre, to the intent to kill and to murther his enemies: nor to rauiſh theyr goods, and to appropriate vnto himſelfe the honour due vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men: but onely to get a good name, and to doe his Prince ſeruice. I might ſpeake many things more of a conqueror, for I haue a large argument, but that is ſpoken ſhall ſuffice: and therefore I will take another matter in hand, which is no leſſe requiſite in an hoaſt then anye other may bee, of which I muſt make a great diſcourſe: to wit, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iuſtice that ought to raigne and to be exerciſed in a Campe, I meane the lawes that men of warre ought to keepe, if they doe intend to doe their duties, and to deſerue the name of good and true Souldiers.</p>

To withſtand this daunger mine opinion is, that after the taking of a towne by an aſſault, which cannot be doone without great miſchiefes, that the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants ſhould auoid the towne whollie, and goe ſeeke ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place to inhabit in far off. And who ſo would ſeperate them ſending part one waye, and part another, ſhould doe wiſely, and the firſt inhabitants being voided, the townes ſhould be repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> aſſigning vnto them their houſes and poſſeſſions. By this meanes the king ſhould bee aſſured of the towne: beſides if hee would place part of his Souldiers in it, he might richely rewarde them with the goods and lands of his enemies. One the other part the townes would not be ſo apte to rebell, and readye to ſtand in armes againſt vs as they are, fearing to be dealt withall as is aforeſaid, whereas they doe now make no difficultie, ſéeing that rebels and recuſants (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that they be conquered) are not conſtrained to change place nor habitations. When as the <hi>Romanes</hi> in times paſt did take any towne by force, they vſed coſtomarilye to take out all the olde inhabitants, and to repleniſh it with a certaine num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other Citizens: and ſometimes with one of their Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: which towne being ſo peopled, was called a <hi>Romane</hi> Colonie: and ſerued the Cittye of <hi>Rome</hi> for a moſt ſtrong Bulwarke, and faithfull Garriſon againſt their enemies: in which dooing they did aſſure their eſtate more and more, and enlarged their Empyre by little and little. So likewiſe might the King doe if the townes that were taken by force of armes, were made <hi>French</hi> Colonies: &amp; that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt inhabitants diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed heere &amp; there within his realme, I meane if he would handle
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:10495:143" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them ſo gentlie, &amp; had not rather to haue them far off then neare. Wée reade concerning this matter that the Children of <hi>Iſraell</hi> vſed their Conqueſts much more rigoruſlie: for in all the lande of <hi>Canaan</hi> they neuer did take one to mercie: but ſlew them all ſmall &amp; great: I beleeue that they did it partly to obey the wil of God, who had ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded them, &amp; partly to aſſure their owne ſtate the better, &amp; not to ſtand alwaies in doubt as they ſhould haue don, if they had ſuffred their enemies to haue liued ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led amongſt them. <hi>Edward</hi> the King of <hi>England</hi> hauing taken the towne of <hi>Callice</hi> (not by aſſault, but by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſition) after that hee had beſiedged it eleuen moneths, droue away vtterlie the people that he found in it, and repleniſhed it wholly with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen</hi> hoping to aſſure himſelfe of the towne, better then if the firſt inhabitants had continued in it: becauſe of the affection he knew that they would alwaies haue caried vnto the <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> and that either firſt or laſt they woulde haue proued to haue retourned vnto their firſt Prince, and haue thruſt out their ſecond: as in trueth it was to be feared. If we will be warned by thoſe examples that doe happen euerie day, and that haue happened in ſuch like caſes within this Realme and elſe where they would make vs to be wiſe &amp; well aduiſed, and keepe vs in time to come from falling into thoſe inconueniences, which the Princes do fall into: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> do not regard to people the towns which they doe win by force with their owne naturall ſubiects, driuing away the vanquiſhed: which in mine opinion is the chiefeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie to withſtand the malice of an enemie, and the treaſons that the vanquiſhed might practiſe againſt their new Lords. The Generall may alſo finde other remidies to bee aſſured of a countrie or towne newly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quered: which is by putting Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons into the foretreſſes which are in them, or which hee may cauſe to be new built in places moſt fit to keepe the country in obedience. He may likewiſe aſſure himſelfe of a place, by ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing vpon the principall perſonages of the countrie, or thoſe that haue the greateſt credit within the Townes, and keepe them for Hoſtages in ſome ſure place. And although that theſe are good meanes to kéepe people of a Prouince in ſubiection: yet the firſt, to weet the making of <hi>French</hi> Colonies is much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: ſpeciallie if wee had conquered them by force as is a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid:
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:10495:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or that they were wearie to be our ſubiects, as the <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> are within ten dayes after that they are conquered: for then they will practiſe nothing ſo much as to be reuenged, or to hunt vs out from amongſt them: and there are no hoſtages that will ſerue the turne: for after that a people doe ſuffer theyr owne deſires to ſurmount them, and doe diſcouer theyr courage: there is nothing in this world that can appeaſe them, but onely force: wherefore we are conſtrained to kéepe alwaies ſtrong Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons amongſt them, and by that meanes are put vnto a maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous charge. As for the townes which doe giue themſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Prince of their owne fréewills, or thoſe that doe yéeld before that any force be doone vnto them, they will not be ſo hard to be kept, as if they had béene taken with violence: ſo that there were no other to bee doubted then they themſelues, I would not greatly care for to giue them any garriſon. But if there were any fortreſſe or caſtle in ſuch a towne, I doe not ſaye but that we ſhould ſeaze vpon it, and furniſh it with people and all things neceſſary, or elſe raze it vtterlye. But if there were none before, I would cauſe none to be builded afterwards: but would doe mine endeuour to winne the hearts of the inhabitants, and to kéepe them in ſubiection more by beneuolence then by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint: hauing a regard not to hurt them either in bodye or goods without great cauſe. Aboue all things the Generall muſt abſtaine from taking of other mens goods: for that men doe ſooner forget the deaths of their parents, then the loſſe of theyr patrimonie: and furthermore he ought to be abſtinent &amp; chaſte, hauing a regard not to defile any mans wife or daughter, either by loue or force: for there is no crime that dooth ſo much offend the hearts of the people, as to ſee their wiues ſeduced or forced: and contrarily no greater meane to winne their hearts, then to vſe chaſtitie and iuſtice towards euery man, imitating <hi>Scipio</hi> the chaſte, and <hi>Caeſar</hi> the iuſt, who obtained with more eaſe the dominions (the one of <hi>Spaine,</hi> &amp; the other of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> through two examples which they did ſhew of their vertue) then by any great force that they did vſe. For <hi>Scipio</hi> although that he was yoong, &amp; a gallant man, yet he reſtored a Gentlewoman of moſt excellent beautie, vnto hir father &amp; huſband, without raunſome:
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:10495:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and as he quitted hir freely ſo he reſtored her vnto her freendes as intirely in hir honour, as ſhee was at the time of hir taking: which act did profit him more then all his force.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Caeſar</hi> being in <hi>Fraunce</hi> payed for the wood that he had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be cut for to fortifie his hoaſt withall: wherein he got ſuch a reputation to be iuſt, that it made his enterpriſes to be atchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with the more eaſe. I ſaye therefore that a Generall that is chaſte and iuſt, ſhall winne the hearts of a people more there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, then by any other meanes that he may vſe. Wheerefore if I were in his place, I would haue as great a care as might bee poſſible, neither to doe them wrong in goods or reputation: and as I would refraine my ſelfe from dooing wrong, ſo would I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that my Souldiers ſhould vſe themſelues well, and that they ſhould ſo behaue themſelues, and liue amongſt others, as they would liue amongſt themſelues, or amongſt their moſt ſpeciall freends. And this were eaſie enough to be done, if that they had béene taught to liue well before, and that Iuſtice had beene ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in the hoaſt. But foraſmuch as there is nothing ſo harde to be doone, as that which a man hath not beene exerciſed in (as appeareth by our Souldiers, who knowes not at what end to begin to doo well, vntill ſuch time as they are conſtrained to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine themſelues from doing euill) if our Leiutenant Generall will haue his Souldiers to bee ſuch as is requiſite that they ſhould be for to exerciſe the arte of the warres as it ought to be exerciſed, and to behaue themſelues in time of peace like honeſt men, hee muſt begin betimes to gouerne them according vnto the militarie lawes of the warres, to the intent that force may be changed into cuſtome, and the cuſtome of well dooing may be conuerted into nature: and by that meanes how naught and corrupt ſoeuer the Souldiers are at the beginning, by vſe they might become honeſt men.</p>
                     <p>I take all thoſe for Militarie lawes, which doe commaund men to liue honeſtly vpon paine of death: that no man ſhould be endomaged without the Generall his leaue, that the king might bee humblye ſerued: and that the faction of the warres ſhould be exerciſed as dutie would, in ſumme, that the Chiefe vnder whoſe charge they ſweare to ſerue, and of whome they
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:10495:145"/>
are waged ſhould be obeyed in all things: which pointes are ſo generall and doe comprehend in them ſo many others, that it is conuenient to ſpecifie them perticularly, principally thoſe that doe condemne vnto death. As for the other lawes that doe not extend vnto the taking awaye of life, I doe referre them vnto the diſcretion of the Prouoſt, and vnto others that haue power and charge to puniſh them that doe not obſerue them. As for the chéefeſt lawes, they are theſe that follow.</p>

For I do meane that the one ſhalbe more grieuouſly puniſhed then the other, hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard vnto the ſhame which is or may proceed of the offence: and who ſo would, that his ſouldiers ſhould not excuſe themſelues with ignorance in this matter, as to ſay that they knew not, that this or that was forbidden, or commaunded, muſt cauſe theſe lawes to be publiſhed through his hoaſt once euery moneth, and alſo cauſe them to be read publikely in the preſence of the legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as often as they doe paſſe muſter. They muſt alſo bee taught them before that the Legions doe aſſemble, and likewiſe when as the armie is aſſembled. For the firſt thing that a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ought to doe, is to foreſee vnto the diſorders that his owne men might commit amongſt themſelues, and afterwardes vnto the domage that they may do vnto the Countrey round about him, if ſo be that they be his friends: and this done, he may with a greater libertie make warres with his enemies, then if he had warres within his armie, and without it with his enemies.</p>
                     <p>We read that Emperour <hi>Frediricke Barbarouſe,</hi> being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into <hi>Italie</hi> with a great armie, to the intent to puniſhe the <hi>Milannois,</hi> who were rebelled, would not begin his wars vntil ſuch time as his men hadde ſworne to obſerue certaine lawes which he eſtabliſhed, becauſe he would take away the occaſion of controuerſies which do happen amongeſt Souldiers, from time to time: and alſo puniſhe thoſe that ſhoulde commit anye diſorder. The example of this Emperour ought our Generall to immitate at the beginning of the aſſembling of his Hoaſt, cauſing them to ſweare, from the hygheſt to the loweſt,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:10495:148"/>
to obſerue the aforeſaid lawes, and to helpe with all their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to maintaine them: and thoſe thinges which I haue ſaid, the Souldiers ſhould be forbidden to do one vnto another: ſhall bee likewiſe forbidden to be done vnto thoſe of the townes that are vnder our obedience, and alſo vnto thoſe of the conquered Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. For reaſon would that we ſhould liue with them as if we were one body.</p>
                     <p>But ſith I haue proceeded ſo farre, I muſt ſpeake of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of iudging and condemning the Souldiers that do not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the aforeſaide lawes, or the ſetting at libertie of thoſe that are wrongfullye accuſed, and to condemne thoſe falſe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers. For after the giuing of lawes, it is neceſſarye, to ſhewe howe the ſame ſhoulde bee executed. For as I haue ſaide bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that it ſerueth to no purpoſe, to make lawes &amp; proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s euery day, if ſo be that they be not kept from point to point. Wherefore ſithence I haue ſpoken of the principall points where on life dooth depend: and thoſe that I doe thinke to bee moſt fit to bridle Souldiers from dooing thoſe euils which they doe moſt commonly commit, it is neceſſarye that the maner of proceeding in iudgement, wherein death conſiſteth ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: for I wil not touch the other at all. For the handling of thys buſines, mee thinke that euery Colonel ought to iudge thoſe of his own legion, taking vnto him his Captains, with their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and officers: who ſhould proceed in that maner that I wil ſhew hereafter. As for that which I haue ſaide in the firſt booke touching the perticular orders of theſe legions, that in euery le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion there ſhould be a prouoſt: I do meane that his office ſhould extend but to the determining of ciuill cauſes, and not to cauſes of life and death, nor after any appeale. So it is that an appeale ſhould neuer be permitted, except the matter did concerne ſome officer, who were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned to be puniſhed corporally, or to do ſome notable penance. But as for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſimple ſouldiers, they ſhold not be permitted to appeale from the iudgment of a prouoſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that he were condemned to die: &amp; then the appeal ſhal come before the Colonel, who with the other iudges aforeſaid, ſhal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine if the party condemned did rightly appeale or not, More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, I doe not meane any way to diminiſh the authritie of the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:10495:148"/>
Prouoſts, nor of my maiſters y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Marſhals, although that I haue appointed other perticuler: for I am not ignorant that they do know all maner of vagabonds, and haue power to puniſh them with death when they doe get them: but for that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Legionaries are ſworne &amp; knowne men, it is requiſite y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhould haue their ordnarie Iudge, who ſhould adminiſter iuſtice vnto them aſwell in ciuill cauſes as in criminall as long as the Legions are vnder their Enſignes: and to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> intent I haue inſtituted vnto euerie Legion a man of lawe, to cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſaile the Colonells: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will not ſpend the time to ſhew the order y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the prouoſts ought to obſerue in their iudgements: for aſmuch as it is to be thought that they ſhould not haue their offices except they vnderſtood how to execute them, and they are clearks of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right ſtamp which I haue appointed them to aſſiſt them in all their courts that they doe holde, when as they would iudge in any matter. I will therefore begin to ſpeake of the maner that the Colonell and his people ought to vſe in their iudgements, and firſt of all I will chuſe a certaine number of Iudges by lot, to auoide confuſion, and the iealouſie that might be had of them that doe iudge: and afterward ſhalbe ſhewed how we muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede to condemne or diſcharge a priſoner. Concerning the firſt point I doe preſuppoſe that the accuſer (I doe meane he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> doth make the reporte) wheather it be one of the preſeruers of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie diſcipline or other, muſt firſt come vnto the Prouoſt of the League and informe him very well of the matter, and this done the Prouoſt ſhall conferre with his counſaile, wheather the partie doe deſerue death or not: if the cafe doe not concerne death he ſhall procéed therein according vnto his charge. But if the crime be ſo haynous y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it doth deſerue death, he ſhall goe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately vnto the Colonell &amp; informe him of it: and thus the matter ſhalbe handled at the firſt complaynt. Concerning the maner of bringing of an appeale before the Colonell, it is too manifeſt. The Collonell being fullie informed of the accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhall cauſe the offender to be taken: and commit him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the cuſtodie of the Prouoſt. If the Colonell doe know that to ſummon him to appeare perſonally will ſerue the turne, the offender ſhalbe ſummoned to appéere perſonally: the one of
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:10495:149"/>
which commiſſions muſt be executed by the Prouoſt &amp; his men, to weete, that of taking him priſoner, except the accuſed were a Chiefe or Member: for in ſuch a caſe, the maiſter of the Camp, or the Seriant maior, accompanied with the Colonell his gard ſhall goe &amp; take them: as for the adiourning the Drume maior or the Colonell his trumpet muſt doe it. If it be late before the accuſed be taken, the matter ſhalbe deferred vntill the next day: but if it were any thing timely, hee ſhall cauſe proclamation to be made, that all the Captaines, Lieutenauntes, Enſignes, Corporals, Chiefes of Squadrons, and Deceniers of his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſhould immediately come vnto his lodging: which procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation being made, all theſe that I haue named ſhall goe thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incontinent, carrying no other armes with them then their ſwords.</p>
                     <p>The Seriants of the bandes muſt bee there alſo: and if the Colonell his lodging or tent bee not great inough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue al this people, the aſſembly muſt be made with out dores: and the Colonel before hee doth proceede further ſhall ſhewe vnto them for what intent he hath called them togither: that is to adminiſter iuſtice vnto his ſouldiers, to preſerue the good from oppreſſion, &amp; to puniſh the offences that the wicked doe commit. If ſo be that this aſſembly were made for to heare any appeale, the Colonell ſhall ſhewe them the matter: and for whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſoeuer of theſe two cauſes it were, hee ſhall cauſe them all to lift vp their handes and to ſweare with one voice, to help to maintaine iuſtice with all their power, againſt all thoſe of the Legion that ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit any crime with out exception of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, except the Colonel, who is to be iudged in an other place &amp; not there. The othe being taken in generall, the Deceniers ſhal aſſemble by them ſelues together, the Chiefes of Squadrons by them ſelues, and the Corporals likewiſe by them ſelues: the Colonell ſhal ſit in a chaire, &amp; ſhall haue two pots ſet at his féet: in the one of which pots there ſhalbe as many leadden bullets as there are Deceniers in one band lacking one, &amp; in ſtéede of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one leadden bullet which wanteth, there ſhalbe a Lattin bullet: ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> amongſt a great many of white bullets there ſhall be one yealow: the other pot ſhall haue nothing in it &amp; ſhalbe ſet at the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:10495:149"/>
Colonell his right foote, and that with the bullets at his left. The Maiſter of the Campe, the Seriant Maior, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoſt and his Clearke ſhall be by him. Theſe two pottes being ſo placed, the Colonell ſhall make ſigne vnto the Dceniers of the firſt bande, who ſhall march one after another according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the order that they are accuſtomed to keepe in the Battailon. The firſt ſhall ſhewe his right hand vnto the Seriant Maior, ſtripping his ſleeue vp vnto the elbow to auoide all ſuſpition of deceipt: and afterward ſhall put his hand into the pot to take out one of the bullets: and ſhall ſhewe the bullet that he doth take vnto the Maiſter of the Campe, to ſhew what bullet that it is: and if it be a leaden bullet the ſaide Decenier ſhall put it into the emptie pot immediatly: and ſhall retourne vnto his lodging, but if he doe drawe the lattin bullet, the Clearke ſhall take his name, and he ſhal ſtand aſide in a place appoynted. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that this firſt Decenier hath drawne, all the reſt of the ſame band ſhall drawe vntill ſuch time as ſome one hath drawne the lattin bullet. And this being done by the Deceniers of the firſt band, the Colonell ſhal cauſe al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaden bullets with the lattin bullet to be ſet againe in their places, remouing the full pot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the emptie pot his place: and ſhall afterwards make ſigne vnto the Deceniers of the ſecond band, to come forward as hee did before vnto thoſe of the firſt: who ſhall doe as they did and ſo ſhal al the other following: ſo that by this meanes when as all the Deceniers of the 12 bands haue drawne, he ſhal haue 12 men of thoſe ſortes of officers ready to iudge. And to the intent that hee might haue as many Chiefes of Squadrons, as Dece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers hee ſhall cauſe the Chiefes of Squadrons to drawe eache band after other, vſing ſo manye bullets with the lattin bullet as are Chiefes of Squadrons in a band, &amp; afterward the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralls ſhall doe as much, one bande after another. Concerning the Members and Captaines they ſhall not drawe bullets at this time: but their number ſhall continew whole. Wherefore of all theſe ſix ſorts of officers, there ſhall be 12 me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of euerie one which is in number 72, that is 6 of euerie band: all which 72 men ſhall range themſelues in forme of a circle, the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell being in the midſt of them, who ſhall commaund the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:10495:150"/>
to be brought. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane while the Drumme Maior ſhal make proclamation that euerie man ſhal repaire vnto his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing except thoſe that haue bin kept as aforeſaid, the maiſter of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Camp, Seriant Maior, and the Seriants of the bands: which Seriants muſt ſtande ſo far from the Counſaile that they may heare nothing. Whilſt this is doing, the Prouoſt ſhal bring the priſoner, and ſhew him all thoſe that are there to giue iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vpon him, and ſhall aduertiſe him to conſider if there bee anie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them that he doth hould ſuſpected, to the intent that hee might bee refuſed incontinent, if ſo bee that the cauſes of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſement are iuſt, and to bee allowed, which cauſes ſhall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred vnto the Colonell. And if ſo be that the ſaid priſoner had a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rarie partie, his ſaid partie might likewiſe refuſe thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he did hould ſuſpect. But ſo it is that neither of them may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe aboue two men of euery one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 6 conditions aboueſaide. And put caſe that this whole number ſhould be refuſed which do make 24 men (for more ſhall not bee permitted to bee refuſed) which refuſed ſhal incontinent depart thence, the other ſhall put themſelues into ſix partes each ſort by themſelues, and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell ſhall ſit downe in his place, and the two pots ſhall be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againe at his feet. The one of them ſhall bee emptie, and the other ſhall haue ſixe bullets of lead, and as many bullets of lattin, as there ſhall remaine Captaines vnrefuſed. And the like ſhall bee afterwards obſerued amongſt Members, and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. Which being ſo ordred the Captaines ſhall goe firſt and drawe out of the pot euerie man in his degree, and thoſe that ſhall happen to drawe bullets of lattin ſhall goe their waies vnto their lodgings: and thoſe that doe drawe leaden bullets muſt ſhew them vnto the maiſter of the Camp, and their names ſhall be written by the Clearke, and afterwards they ſhal place themſelues on either ſide of the Colonell: the one halfe on the one ſide and the other one the other. After this the Seriant Maior ſhall againe put ſixe bullets of lead into one pot, and as many bullets of lattin, as there are Lieutenants more then ſix, which Lieutenants ſhall doe as the Captaines haue don, &amp; the Enſigne bearers ſhal do the like after the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequently y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals, and after them the Chiefs of Squadrons, and finally the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:10495:150"/>
Deceniers. By this laſt lot the number of the Iudges ſhallbe reduced vnto 36. perſons, not coumpting the Colonell, which 36. Iudges ſhall raunge themſelues 18. on the one ſide, and 18. on the other, in manner of an angle: and the Colonell ſhalbe the angle, the Seriants of the bands ſhalbe there as aſſiſtants, but they ſhalbe farre of &amp; euery man alone by himſelf. The Colonell his guard ſhalbe round about the Counſaile, and ſo farre of that they may not vnderſtand what doth paſſe. The matter being this ordred, the Colonell ſhall cauſe the priſoner to be brought, who being brought by the Prouoſt, his Cleark ſhal recite before them all the contents of the information, and the depoſitions of the witneſſes (if that there be any) whereunto the priſoner ſhall anſwer &amp; ſhalbe heard to ſpeake. And if ſo be that he do deny the fact, the witneſſes ſhalbe brought before him: &amp; for want of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, if the preſumptions bee great, the Colonell with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe of the ſayd Counſaile, ſhall condemne him vnto the racke, and ſhall paſſe vnto iudgement, or deferre it vntill the next day, or longer if it be neceſſarie. As concerning the condemning or releaſing of a priſoner, it ſhalbe handled as here followeth: that is, after that the Prouoſt hath made his demaund in the behalfe of the King, &amp; the partie, if there be any, hath made his demaund for his domage: and that the ſayd priſoner hath anſwered from poynt to poynt, the Counſaile ſhalbe left alone, and the priſoner and his accuſer alſo ſhall be put a little a ſide out of the ſight of the Iudges. Vpon this the Cleark ſhal reade y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euidences before them all: &amp; the Iudges there preſent ſhall heare it, the maiſter of the Camp, the Seriant maior, &amp; none other. The euidences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing read at large, the Colonell ſhall declare vnto them that they are aſſembled for to iudge according vnto the truth, &amp; not for any fauour that they do beare vnto the priſoner, his parentage, or frends, nor likewiſe for hatred: &amp; therfore that euery man ſhould ſpeake his minde according vnto his conſcience, following the lawes of the warres, &amp; not otherwiſe: for in this buſines of the warres there muſt be no fauour nor lenitie vſed, but only the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of the lawes which haue béen made for men of warre, the which ſhalbe regiſtred in a table, as I haue ſaid before, &amp; the ſaid table ſhalbe alwaies hanged before the Colonell his tent, or the gate of his lodging, to the intent that it may bee in ſight, that
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:10495:151"/>
euery man may knowe what he ought to flye for to auoyde the daunger of Iuſtice. And the ſayd table ſhalbe brought and read by the Cleark from the one end vnto the other. And this done, the Colonell ſhall commaund the Seriant maior to giue vnto euery one of the ſayd Iudges three bullets: vpon one of which bullets there ſhall bee a great <hi>R,</hi> which ſhall ſignifie to releaſe: vpon another a great <hi>C,</hi> which ſhall ſignifie to condemne: and vpon the third there ſhall be a great <hi>I,</hi> which ſhall ſignifie to bée better informed of the matter: one of theſe three bullets ſhall bee vſed when as they would releaſe, or condemne, or when as the proofes are not ſufficient to releaſe or condemne, but that they would be better informed.</p>
                     <p>After that euery one of theſe haue receiued three bullets, as is aforeſayd, and the Colonell thrée likewiſe as the others: the Seriant maior ſhall place two emptie pottes at the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell his féete, the one ſomewhat diſtant from the other, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which pottes the Iudges ſhall come one after another: to weete, the Deceniers firſt, the Chiefes of Squadrons next, and the others following, and after them the Captaines, and the Colonell laſt of all. Euery one of them ſhall put the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let by which he doth pretend to ſignifie his opinion into the pot appoynted for the purpoſe, and the other two bullets into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pot, and afterwards ſhall returne vnto their places. And the Colonell ſhall cauſe the pot of their opinions to bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, to ſee if the bullets that do releaſe be more then 18. and if ſo be that it ſhould happen that the priſoner ſhould be releaſed ſimplie and purely, he might bring the partie afterwards to his aunſwere, that did accuſe him &amp; wrongfully ſweare againſt him. But if ſo be that the bullets which do condemne are more then 18. the Colonell ſhal pronounce the iudgement of death againſt the priſoner. And when as neither ſort of bullets do exceede the one halfe of the number of Iudges; becauſe that ſome perhaps might require that the matter might bee better looked into: in which caſe the iudgement ſhall be referred vntill the next day, or two daies after. In the meane while the Prouoſt and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile ſhall preciſely ouerſee the euidences, to ſee if there were any poynt that were not well verified, to the intent to put the indite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in good order, and take from the Iudges all occaſions of
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:10495:151"/>
prolonging iudgement. If the priſoner be releaſed, there is no more to be done, but that he may returne vnto his lodging when as he will. But if ſo be that the matter be deferred vntill another day, the Colonell ſhall appoynt the day and houre, when the Counſaile ſhall méete againe, at which day and houre the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhall be brought againe by the Prouoſt. This delay of ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the matter is not euidently enough prooued, may bee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed three times, and not aboue: and then the Seriant maior ſhall giue but two ſorts of bullets: to weet, thoſe two that do releaſe or condemne: but if he be condemned, ſo that there be 19. bullets or more marked with <hi>C,</hi> the Colonell ſhall immediatly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that the priſoner is condemned: &amp; then the Seriant ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior ſhall ſet the two emptie pots at the Colonell his feete, as before, and ſhall giue foure bullets vnto euery one of the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: vpon the one of which bullets ſhall be a great <hi>S,</hi> which ſhall ſignifie for to ſmite off his head: vpon another ſhall bee a great <hi>G,</hi> which ſhall ſignifie that he hath deſerued the gallowes: vpon the third there ſhall be a great <hi>P,</hi> which ſhall ſignifie to paſſe the Pikes: vpon the fourth ſhall be an <hi>H,</hi> which ſhall ſignifie that the priſoner ſhall be ſhot to death with Harquebuziers: wherevpon the Iudges ſhall put the bullets of their opinions (which ſort of death they do thinke the crime hath deſerued) into the pot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted: and if there were more bullets found in the pot mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with <hi>S,</hi> then with any one of the other letters, the priſoner ſhall haue iudgement to haue his head to bee ſmitten of. Likewiſe, if there were more bullets marked with <hi>P,</hi> then with any other letter, the priſoner ſhall bee iudged to paſſe the Pikes: and ſo likewiſe of the others; which iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall bee firſt regiſtred in wrighting, and afterwarde pronounced by the Colonell. And if ſo bée the priſoner ſhould looſe his head, or bée hanged, he ſhall bée deliuered vnto the Prouoſt to bee executed. And if ſo bée that he ſhould bee condemned to paſſe the Pikes, or bée Harquebuzzed, hée ſhall bée deliuered vnto the Seriants of the bande, for this execution appertayneth vnto Souldiers. And if this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution were the firſt that were made in the Legion, the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of the firſt band ſhould do it: and the other executions muſt
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:10495:152"/>
bée done afterwards by the other bands euery one in his turne.</p>
                     <p>After this manner muſt bee proceeded as often as any man ſhalbe condemned to dye, and more preciſely if it were poſſible: and after the ſentence pronounced, it ſhalbe neceſſarie to proceed vnto the execution immediatly without ſhewing mercie vnto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man whoſoeuer it were. For if one offender ſhall be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the Souldiers would afterwards haue the leſſe care to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine from offending. And likewiſe, if any man were attainted of crime, and ſhould ſuffer death for the ſame, he would take it the more impatiently, for that mercie ſhould be vſed vnto ſome, and not vnto others. Concerning the manner of procéeding in appeales, in theſe caſes which do not concerne death, it ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice that all the ſummons be made publikely, except the laſt: but for to iudge any man vnto death, we muſt proceed ſecretly as I haue ſayd: which neede not to bee ſo handled when as the fault doth not deſerue ſo haynous a puniſhment: for in ſuch caſes a man may declare his opinion openly, and ſpeake his mind with out vſing of bullets. Concerning the puniſhment of the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that appertaineth vnto their Captaine, and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Captaines vnto their Generall, who likewiſe is vnder the iuſtice of the King his Lieutenant, whileſt they are in the warres, or elſewhere vnder his charge: or elſe if it be in time of peace, the ordinarie Iuſtice of the countrie will looke into them, reſeruing the qualitie of their eſtates, in which caſe my Lords the Marſhals of <hi>Fraunce</hi> will looke to haue a ſaying vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: but being in Campe, or elſewhere vnder the charge of the Lieutenant Generall, the Iuſtice of euery Captaine of an hundred men of armes ought to puniſh his owne men: and for default therof, the Generall might be complained vnto. A Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of an hundred men of armes, may chuſe certaine of his own officers to aſſiſt him in his iudgements, if he will: and may vſe his owne authoritie or lot, which he thinketh beſt, without calling any other aſſiſtance vnto him, but his owne members, who at the leaſt ought to bee called: yet men of warre do with greater patience ſuffer puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, when as they do ſee that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Iudges are aſſembled to iudge them, then when as they are wholly referred vnto three or foure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="277" facs="tcp:10495:152"/>And if that they do vſe lots, the manner before ſhewed neede not to be greatly altered, becauſe there are Chiefes amongſt the horſemen aſwell as amongſt the footmen: of which Chiefs there may be a certaine number taken to haue the hearing of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the Marſhall that is appoynted to lodge the horſemen, muſt execute the office of the Prouoſt, aſwell for to informe, as to accuſe: and moreouer, the execution muſt be done by the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Generall of the horſemen his Prouoſt, or by themſelues, in the ſelfe-ſame manner that the footmen do: for, as the one ſort haue Pikes, ſo the other haue Launces, and either of them haue Harquebuziers: but I will not ſtand longer vpon this matter, but will ſhew that the manner of procéeding in iudgement with bullets, hath two good conſiderations in it. The firſt is, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Colonell, nor Captaines, haue authoritie to iudge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. The other is, that thoſe that do iudge, do not ſpeake their opinions publikely: but with ſilence do ſignifie their opinions by a bullet: which two manners me thinke are very good; bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then to giue authoritie wholly vnto the Colonells or Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to iudge according vnto their owne willes, and without information, as they might ſometimes do through hatred or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, if a priſoner ſhould be ſet at libertie, or condemned by a ſmall number of Iudges, thoſe that ſhould ſkanne vpon the matter might ſooner haue an euill opinion of a ſmall number then of a great, and the common Souldiers would exclaime that their right were ouerthrowne, becauſe there ſhould bee no bodie on their ſides to maintaine it: for which cauſe I haue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted a certaine number of Deceniers, who haue a more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie with the common Souldiers, and a greater authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to ſpeake vnto the chiefeſt, then the common Souldiers haue with their Captaines. I haue likewiſe appoynted Chiefes of Squadrons, Corporalles, and Members, as many of the one ſort as of the other, to make them all (in the ſeate of Iuſtice) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall in authoritie one with another. Moreouer, to auoyd all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of enuie amongſt them, I haue choſen them all by lot, ſo that the one cannot ſay that he hath béen preferred; nor the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he hath béen reiected; except that the priſoner did refuſe
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:10495:153"/>
him, and that the cauſe of the refuſall were iuſt. Concerning that the ſayd Iudges do deliuer their opinions ſecretly, it is to the intent that they ſhould do it more freely, then they would do if that they ſhould ſpeake their opinions in the hearing of all men: for ſometimes they might be troubled for iudging indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, becauſe that the priſoner might be either parent or friend vnto ſome one of them, or that they might before haue receiued ſome good turne at his hands: whervpon they might be thought to bee ingratefull, if they did not requite a good turne at a néede: which is a reaſon to withdrawe the hearts of thoſe that haue béen beholding vnto him, from iudging according vnto equitie, although that the crime were the moſt haynous and moſt deteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table that might be poſſible: ſpecially if euery mans iudgement ſhould be knowe afterwards: for in ſuch a caſe there would very hardly bee any man, that would renounce the friendſhip of the priſoner, or would incurre the indignation of his parents, if he were a man of any reputation: but moreouer would make a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie to do any thing againſt him, who before had done them pleaſure, or who had meanes, and friends to do them the like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Furthermore, if their opinions ſhould bee verbally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, it would bee doubtfull that the one of them would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon anothers opinion: ſpecially if they thought the firſt ſpeakers to be men of iudgement: and it might bee that ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them durſt not contrarie the firſt ſpeakers, which might be an occaſion ſooner to ſowe diſcord, then to roote it out. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, who ſo would haue the occaſions of hatred amongſt Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to be wholly quenched, and extinguiſhed, and that wicked men which do not their duetie as they ought to do, ſhould bee pluckt out from amongſt good men; muſt vſe no other meane but iudge according vnto equitie. And to iudge iuſtly according vnto the lawe, the ſureſt way is that euery man ſhould deliuer his opinion ſecretly with a bullet: for ſo doing, it will be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for any man to knowe who hath releaſed or condemned the priſoner: becauſe that euery one of the Iudges ſhall knowe but only what he himſelfe hath done; but not not what his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions haue done. And in this doing euery man will imploye himſelfe to do his duetie, and iudge according vnto the law, not
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:10495:153"/>
periuring himſelfe any way to ſpare or condemne a priſoner wrongfully; who neuer ſhall come by the true knowledge who it was that did him good or hurt. To conclude, I do eſteeme this forme of iudgement to bee the beſt and moſt ſureſt that may bée vſed in this caſe: albeit that iudgement may bee handled after diuers other manners: but after this manner ſhould a Colonell handle his iudgements, if ſo be that he would maintaine good iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice amongſt his hands, and make his Souldiers to liue like honeſt men. But if the manner before ſpoken of ſhould ſeeme to be too long a worke: I do know no better way, then to leaue the determination of all matters vnto the Prouoſts, and that they ſhould iudge all Souldiers, whether they were Chiefes, offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, or ſimple companions: which Prouoſt ſhould be inioyned to adminiſter good and ſhort iuſtice vnto all men, and to puniſh thoſe rigorouſly that did not vſe their vocations as they ought to do. And when as the crimes were ſuch, or the perſons of that qualitie, that it were not conuenient to procéed in iudgement im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, and preſently to do execution, becauſe of the mutinie, and cauſe of offence that it might giue; it would ſuffice to do it aſſoone as it might be conueniently done: and if ſo be that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender might not bee taken by day, or that it would bee daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to do execution, there muſt both be ſtay made of the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending, and puniſhing, vntill a fitter time: or the offender might be taken by night, or at the firſt holding vp of his finger, or at ſuch time as he doth thinke that the offence is forgotten, and doth thinke leaſt of it: to the intent that iuſtice might be well maintained, and that the crime which is deferred to be puniſhed for a time, be not altogether forgotten.</p>

                        </hi> Will here inferre certaine examples of the ſeueritie that the auncient Chiefes in times paſt haue vſed towards their Souldiers, when as they did commit any great offence; I doe meane capitall crimes: which were committed after one of theſe two manners, either by one man onely, or by many (for ſometimes whole Legions did offend) and were puniſhed either perticularly or in generall. As for perticular perſons, I do finde that the auncient Chiefes did puniſh chiefly all thoſe that were not at their watches with their Enſignes, or with thoſe whome they ought to followe in ſuch like ſeruices: they likewiſe were puniſhed that went fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their watch after they were in it. Alſo he was puniſhed that did forſake the place he ought to keepe or to fight in, or that did vaunt that he had done any good ſeruice, and was afterwards prooued a lyar. He alſo was as ſure to looſe his life that fought with his enemies without leaue, or expreſſe charge, as if he had been ſlaine by them. Moreouer, they that did throw away their armes for feare of their enemies, and thoſe which did flye from a battaile, had their payment likewiſe with the others. Concerning generall faults; if the Legions did vſe any rebellion againſt their Chiefes, or if that they did mutine, or did flye from their enemies, the cuſtome was to put a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them vnto death, or the chiefeſt rebels: the leaſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was to caſſier them quite &amp; cleane fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ordinary bands, and conſequently to pronounce them to be infamous, and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of all thoſe priuiledges, which the other Souldiers who ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued their time, and went away with the good willes of their Chiefes, did inioy and their children. Of which perticular and generall faults, I haue here inferred certaine examples: by
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:10495:154"/>
which ſhall be ſhewed how the auncient Chiefes, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good Souldyers long ſince, haue grieuouſly puniſhed all thoſe that did not their duties in the warres, and thoſe likewiſe that did commit any crime of importance. Chiefely diſloyaltie was had in contempt amongſt them: and all thoſe that did fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifie their faiths, were grieuouſly puniſhed with the moſt cruell death that could be deuiſed: as appeareth by <hi>Mutius Suffetius,</hi> who was pluckt in pieces betwixt two Waggons, becauſe of his diſloyaltie vnto <hi>Tullius</hi> King of <hi>Rome</hi> in forſaking him, when as the <hi>Romans</hi> and the ſaid King fought againſt theyr neighbours, and that he ſhould haue ſuccoured them with his men being there preſent with them, and ſent for vnto that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: who in ſtead of ayding the ſayd <hi>Romans,</hi> and entring into battaile with them, ſtoode ſtill to ſée what ſucceſſe they ſhould haue in their fight: by meanes of which diſſimulation, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were in great doubt and ieopardy being forſaken, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to deale with two great armyes, to wéet, the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and the <hi>Fidenats,</hi> who were aſſembled againſt the Citie of <hi>Rome:</hi> but it came ſo to paſſe that the <hi>Romans</hi> got the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and <hi>Tullius</hi> ſeazed vppon the traytor, cauſing him to be put to death in the ſight of all his partakers after the manner afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd. I do put in amongſt theſe diſloyall perſons all thoſe ſtrangers which ſometime ſerue the King, and do forſake him at his néede, or do go away vnto his enemies without aſking leaue: which diſloyaltie in mine opinion is ſo deteſtable, that it cannot be ynough contemned, nor puniſhed ſo grieuouſly as it doth deſerue, becauſe it is a deceiuing of God and man: which crime is more practiſed at this day then euer it was, eſpecially amongſt a great number of <hi>Italyans,</hi> which do nothing but trot too and fro, now to one, and to morrow vnto another, not ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long in a place (but like peaſon boyling in a pot) and that for euery light occaſion, ſo that there are very fewe of them that can vaunt that they haue alwayes held vppon one ſide, ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is the ſaid Nation ſubiect to the changing of opinions: and thoſe whome the King hath mainteined long time, are the woorſt, who do forſake him as if they neuer had knowne him, ſooner without taking their leaues, then otherwiſe: and this
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:10495:155"/>
they do aſwell in time of warre as in peace, which is moſt diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and infamous, for at the leaſt they ſhould take their leaues before that they did forſake his ſeruice. I dare ſay that amongſt the ſimple ſouldiers there is not one that hath continued in his ſeruice during the warres without going vnto his enemies, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Chiefs haue had ſo good an eye vnto them, as that they could not eſkape when they would: ſo are there others likewiſe that do come from our enemies vnto vs, and ſo they do trot too &amp; fro, not reſting long in a place, yea, ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that haue not caried one moneth in a place, do runne away the next day after that they haue paſſed muſter. Our owne countreymen do the like oftimes, many of them imitating the <hi>Italyans</hi> going vnto our enemyes, making no more difficultie then if they were ſtranges: there are alſo many of them that go home vnto their owne houſes, and other that do go from one band vnto another aſſoone as they haue receiued their money, not making any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of the oath that they haue taken, making God as their compagnion, making no accompt of the Kings money which they do carry away &amp; ſteale from him as approued théeues, trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, &amp; periured perſons, ſo that there is not almoſt one ſouldier y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath the feare of God, nor the reuerence due vnto chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion before his eyes, for if they had, the oathes and promiſes which they do make ſhould be obſerued, &amp; the wickednes which they do commit, ſhould not be committed: but for that they do not feare him they do diſpraiſe him, &amp; diſpraiſing him, it is not poſſible that they ſhould kéepe any thing that they do ſweare in his name. Is it poſſible that they ſhould feare him whoſe name they do blaſpheme &amp; contemne in all their communications? as we ſée they do, therefore there is no other remedy but to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell them by mans lawes to obſerue that, which they do make no reckning to kéepe by Gods lawes: and mine opinion is that it ſhould be decreed, that who ſo euer ſhould be found in this fault, were he <hi>Frenchman</hi> or ſtranger, ſhould immediatly be beaten to death with mallets, or buried aliue, or pluckt in pieces with foure horſes, or haue a ſtake thruſt through his body, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are too gentle for ſuch a crime. And as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the diſloialty of thoſe which do go vnto our enemies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking their leaues before that they beare armes againſt the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:10495:155"/>
King, which liberty of departure with leaue is only to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto thoſe that are not bound vnto him either by faith or homage. I haue read one example of <hi>Henry</hi> the 7. Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> who cauſed an execution to be made in his Campe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he beſieged the City of <hi>Breſſe,</hi> vpon an <hi>Italyan</hi> named <hi>Galleas Bruſat,</hi> who forſooke him without leaue, and ſerued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him with his enemies, who being taken by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour his men at a ſally that he made out of the ſaid towne, was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly pluckt in péeces with Waggons. This example need not to be accompted auncient, for it is not aboue 200. yeares ſince it hapned, yet I haue alleaged it auncient, becauſe that the manner of puniſhing of this offence doth like me better then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we do vſe at this time, which is either to hang, or to behead, or to paſſe the pikes, which puniſhments are to be thought to be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous ynough for many other crimes which the ſouldiers do commit, but for ſuch an offence as this, I do thinke them to be too gentle: wherefore I will continue in mine opinion, that one of the aforeſaid puniſhments ought to be vſed in this caſe, for theſe commers &amp; goers are cauſes of too many inconueniences, and therefore when that any of them are taken, they ſhould be ſo handled, that the remembrance of their puniſhment ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine for an example for euer: and aboue all things we muſt neuer let ſuch a crime ſcape vnpuniſhed, if we haue opportunity to puniſh it. The <hi>Romans</hi> had a great regard not to pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their fugitiues, nor to reſtore the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto their goods, or firſt honors, nor to truſt them at any time after with any charge whatſoeuer it were, as we do at this preſent, but they were aſſured to be put to a moſt cruell death whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſoeuer that they were taken, whereof we haue many examples in their hiſtories, ſpecially of thoſe which <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in certain townes which he tooke fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                        <hi>Anniball,</hi> who being ſent vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> wer firſt of all whipt, &amp; afterward throwne downe from an high rock. Certaine fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues that were deliuered vnto <hi>Scipio</hi> by an accord y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was made betwixt the <hi>Romans</hi> &amp; the <hi>Carthagenians,</hi> ſome were behea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, &amp; others crucified. The aforeſaid <hi>Fabius</hi> at another time cauſed the hands of all the fugitiue <hi>Romans,</hi> and other ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers fugitiues y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had ſerued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be cut off, which he did, to the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the remembrance of the offence &amp; puniſhment might be
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:10495:156"/>
refreſhed as often as they were ſéene that had loſt their hands. Yet me thinke that theſe pernitious people, although that they were maymed of their hands, ſhould not therefore leaue to do many miſchiefes, hauing the other parts of their bodies whole, wherefore I would at the leaſt diſpatch them of all at once.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Paulus Aemelius</hi> after that he had vanquiſhed <hi>Perſeus</hi> King of <hi>Macedony,</hi> made all the fugitiues that were found in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemyes hoaſt to be ſlaine by Elephants: the ſonne of the ſayd <hi>Paulus,</hi> to wéet, that <hi>Scipio</hi> which razed <hi>Carthage,</hi> condemned all the fugitiues that he could lay hands vpon, to be quartered and deuoured with wilde beaſts. <hi>Auidius Caſſus,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, haue procéeded in the like buſines moſt ſeuéerely, and yet not ſo rigorouſly, but that they haue deſerued a great deale more. Moreouer, the ſaid Chiefs did moſt ſharply puniſh thoſe which did not obey the Proclamations and commaundements that were made by their Chiefes, as appeareth by the example of <hi>Manlius Torquatus,</hi> who cauſed his owne ſonne to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed for fighting with his enemyes contrary to his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement: and the victorie which he got ſaued not his life, and yet he was challenged y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Combat body for body, of which chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge he could not rid his hands with honeſty, if there had not bin commandement vnto the contrary: the ſaid <hi>Mutius</hi> prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the obſeruation of militarie diſcipline before fatherly loue, and cauſed his ſonne to be put to death. Within a little after there was ynough to do, for that <hi>Quintus Fabius,</hi> Captayne Generall of the <hi>Romane</hi> Horſſemen, fought with his enemies contrary vnto the commaundement of the Dictator <hi>Papyrius Curſor,</hi> who although that he had ouerthrowne his ſaid ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes, yet the Dictator would haue put him to death for hys diſobedience, ſo highly was this diſcipline and obedience e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtéemed amongſt them aboue all things, without the which they knewe that the occupation of armes whereof they made their profeſſion, and for which they were honored and feared more then any other Nation, would be aboliſhed in ſhort time, without the which, the Chiefes did neither deſerued to be called Chiefes, nor the ſouldyers true ſouldyers, but might bée ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coumpted to be a diſordred multitude, if the Chiefes were not
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:10495:156"/>
obeyed, nor the ſouldyers ſhewed themſelues to be obedient: and thus much concerning the principall offences which ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyers do commit during the warres, and the diſorders which they do, being in Campe, as running ouer the countrey, raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoming their hoaſts, eating them vnto the boanes, pilling them, beating them that they do dye of it, and forcing their Wiues and daughters, and to be ſhort, for all the other outrages which they do. I haue many examples worthy to be remembred in ſuch like caſes, and thoſe that haue happened ſpecially amongſt Heathen men, that haue had no knowledge of God, nor of his truth, who notwithſtanding would not ſuffer that this wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſhould raigne amongſt them, for the aforeſaide <hi>Auidius Caſsius</hi> doing all his endeuour to reſtore the diſcipline of the warres vnto his intier, after that it was made baſe and come to nothing, ordained that the ſouldiers that did take any thing from the people of the countrey where he came, ſhould be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied vppon the place. <hi>Peſeinius</hi> the blacke, a great obſeruer of auncient diſcipline, did condemne a whole Deceine of ſouldiers vnto death, for that they had taken a Cocke from a poore coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyman, and had eaten it, but to haue the good wills of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who inſtantly beſought him to ſhewe mercy, he pardoned them, with condition that they ſhould recompence the poore man with tenne times as much as the Cock was worth: and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, that no ſouldier of the Deceine ſhould kindle fire as long as the warres laſted, nor ſhould eate any thing but dry &amp; rawe fleſh. <hi>Alexander Seuerus</hi> did ſharply &amp; grieuouſly puniſh any of his ſouldiers that did go out of their way to runne into any houſe to do any domage, hauing always theſe honeſt words in his mouth, <hi>Do not that vnto others, that thou wouldeſt not haue other do vnto thee.</hi> It were neceſſary that Captaynes at this day ſhould vſe the like diligence, for to auoide the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that ſouldiers do commit in marching vppon the way, for there ſhall hardly be houſe or village vpon the way, either farre or néere, but ſhall féele them, for they would be verie ſorie if they had not left tokens behinde them, or that the countrey ſhould not haue occaſion to remember their paſſage long time after. I do not ſpeake for thoſe places which do ofttimes reſiſt to giue
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:10495:157"/>
lodging vnto the King his good ſeruants, who march at his commaundement, to ſuccour him in his extremitie, as many walled townes within this realme are accuſtomed to do, for a brauerie, or preſuming vpon their ſtrength, although that the ſayde ſouldyers do demaund nothing but lodging and victuals. In which caſe me thinke there would be no great hurt done if that they might be ſhewed what difference there is betwixt theſe ſubiects that do abandon their goodes, and hazarde theyr liues to ſerue their Prince: and thoſe that are good for nothing but to rake vp the fire, and to hurt thoſe that do him ſeruice. But I do ſpeake concerning villages, open places, and houſes that ſtand ſkattered héere and there, who haue neither power nor will to reſiſt, whome they do vſe like vnto places that had reſiſted them, and done them much hurt: ſo that there are but fewe Townes, Villadges, or houſes that can ſkape frée whereas men of warre do paſſe, but they ſhall be let bloud in the purſſe, either by the Captaynes, or harbingers, if ſo be that they were too farre out of the way for the ſouldyers. And if the ſouldyers ſhould come there, it would be worſſe, for that there is no man, or if there be any, it is very fewe, that do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe them from doing euill, for that there are many Chiefes that do make no other accoumpt, but that euery man might do what he would himſelfe, for that they do reaſonably well for their owne partes. Moreouer, it would be very hard to make the ſimple ſouldyers to liue honeſtly, and their ſuperiours to make their hands, for the rule muſt be generall, and the ſmall muſt imitate the great. This taking that I ſpeake of is ſo v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall at this day, that robbery doth ſéeme to be but a rent, ſo that there is no accompt made to puniſh thoſe that do ranſacke the places y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are in their paſſage: I do ſpeake both of the Captaines &amp; ſouldiers that do pillage the countrey. Thoſe likewiſe ought to be puniſhed which do ſéeke to corrupt Captains, or harbin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, cauſing them to paſſe any one place to goe vnto another: and thoſe alſo ought not to goe frée which do take vpon them to lodge in any place with intent to be reuenged of the ſaid place through the charge, trouble, and domage that ſouldiers ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily do whereas they lodge, and being lodged to ſuch an
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:10495:157"/>
intent, it will make their willes ſharper to do ill, who of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues are ſo ſharpe, that they néede no whetſtone, for in ſuch a caſe there would be but too many aſkers found, whereas if puniſhment were vſed, there ſhould be no man would put for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>The aforeſaide manner of rebellion doth deſerue to haue an expreſſe order made, commaunding that Souldyers which do march through the countrey with good commiſſion, ſhould be readily obeyed, and if ſo be that the ſaid ſouldyers did commit any crime, except ſatiſfaction were made im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, the townes where the crime was committed, ſhould be holden, to ſend accuſations and complaints vnto the Leute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Generall, or vnto the Gouernour of the countrey, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tache the Chiefe himſelfe. Moreouer to ſpeake truly, to ſuffer a baggage towne, or a good, to ſhut their gates againſt men of warre, which do goe to ſerue the King, and do vſe themſelues like honeſt men, there is neither reaſon nor order in it, for firſt of all it is a reſiſtance againſt the King who doth pay them, ſecondly, it is the way to famiſh the poore men. Moreouer it may be that they may take their ill vſing in ſo ill part as to leaue their Captaine in the lurtch that hath bin at the charge to leuy them, and returne home againe. Furthermore, this refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall might encourage the countrey people to be as vnreaſonable as the townes that do ſhut their gates, and cauſe them to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble themſelues a great number together to charge them, imagining that they might lawfully do it, foraſmuch as the townes did reſiſt the ſaid ſouldiers. And I leaue it vnto your conſideration to thinke vnto what end all theſe inconueniences might come. For the ſhutting of the ſouldyers out of theyr townes, is in truth the way to ruyne them, for that the ſuburbs of townes are not commonly ſo great, that all the ſouldyers of one, or many bands may lye couered ouer head, and in ſuch places the ſayde towne may ſtande, as there is neither houſe nor buſhe néere, who then hauing no tents with them (as they are accuſtomed to carry none) except that the place haue many trées in it for them to cut downe, which would be too great a domage, they muſt lye in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deaw all night, &amp; therfore how little

time ſoeuer that this courſe doth laſt, they do fall ſick, and dye by the way, whereas elſe they would come freſh vnto the Campe, &amp; in ſtate to do ſeruice: in ſumme, it is the way to make both the Captaines and Souldiers to diſpaire, and to cauſe them to do thoſe things, which when they are done, might diſpleaſe both parties, and when all is well wayed it muſt be ſo: for we do ſay commonly, that of two euils, we muſt auoide the greateſt, for in mine opinion, there would be leſſe hurt to enter forcibly into one of theſe rebell townes, and rather into the firſt that ſhould ſtand vppon theſe tearmes, then any other, to make the reſt afrayde: prouided that they did kill no body if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and that there might be no rauiſhing of women, Church robberies, or other diſorders committed, then to ſuffer reſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or to haue a warre with the countrey all alongſt their way, or to be in danger of famine, or of being ouerthrowne, or of falling ſicke for want of lodging, and ſo to returne home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, for theſe are matters of a greater domage, then the forceible taking of a place, foraſmuch as of the one there doth enſue but the domage of certaine reſiſtants, who are the firſt cauſers of the ſtrife; and of the other might procéede the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit of many poore Captayns, for that they might be vnfurni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed of their people to ſerue their Prince, which is a hard match for them, and ynough to throwe them downe from honor all the dayes of their life, beſides the daunger that they are in to be ſlaine by their owne ſouldiers, if ſo be that they did mutin du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoſe troubles, as hath hapned many times in like caſes. On the other part the King might find himſelfe ſo vnprouided of people, &amp; ſo forced by his enemyes, that a ſmall power might do him great ſeruice, and perhaps giue him the victorie, for I haue vſed it for a prouerbe, that a thouſand men ſometimes are not worth one, and at others one is worth a thouſand. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, if the bands that ſhould be taken vp in <hi>Fraunce</hi> ſhould find theſe rebellions, there is no man although he were willing that could do him ſeruice, ſo that the King ſhould be vnprouided of ſouldiers at all times when as he had néede, wherefore all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, me thinke that there might be a time found to chaſten theſe rebels, ſéeing that the ſouldiers do enter and lodge in the

beſt Citties of the Realme, when as they are commaunded to marche: or there ſhould bee a generall lawe, that they ſhould altogether lie in the fields, or elſe that they ſhould be receiued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the townes that were appointed for them to lodge in: and not to ſuffer certaine perticular places to reſiſt, whereas all <hi>Fraunce</hi> in generall dooth obey. But to leaue this matter, to the intent that aſwell the Captaines as the Souldiers ſhould know that the vertue of the Heathen hath beene ſuch, that they did forbid their people to do, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which we Chriſtians do amongſt vs, in deuouring and oppreſſing one another, that the wicked might amend their liues. I am about to declare what the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Aurelian</hi> did write vnto his Lieutenant Generall, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the life of his Souldiers: the tenor of his letter was this.</p>
                     <p>If ſo bee that thou art determined to bee my Lieutenant, or if thou wilt liue long, it were neceſſarye that thou ſhouldeſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, that no Souldier ſhould bee ſo bould, as to take a Hen or a ſheepe from any man, or to carrye away a plant of a Vine, or to ſpoile the ſéede vpon the grounde: nor likewiſe that they ſhould conſtraine anye man to giue them oyle, wood, or other thing: but ſhould content themſelues with that portion of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals, that was deliuered them out of the ſtore. Furthermore thou ſhalt forbid them to make anye bootie or prea of the poore peoples goods that are our freends, but onely prea vpon our enemies.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer thou ſhalt enioyne them, that euerye man ſhall haue his harnes cleane and bright at all times, his weapons ſharpe and well kept, the Souldiers them ſelues to bee well hoaſed, and when as they are newe apparrelled, let them rid them ſelues off the olde quight &amp; cleane: cauſe them to keepe their wages warely, and ſuffer them not to ſpend it in drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe or in Tauernes. What ſo euer they be that haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten any priſe by force of armes, as Bracelets, Collers, or Rings, let them be worne ordinarilie.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, for the horſemen, let them curry and rubbe their Horſes of price them ſelues, if any of them doe make
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:10495:159"/>
any bootie of Cattle, ſuffer them not to bee ſoulde, but let them remaine in the hoaſte for the ſeruice of Souldiers, or for foode: and let euerye one of them in his turne looke vnto the Mule or Horſe that is appointed to carrye the Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage of the Deceine or Squadron that hee is of. Moreouer, thou ſhalt make thy Souldiers to bee ſeruiceable one vnto another as if they were bounde vnto this dutie as ſlaues: and cauſe the Chirurgeons to heale them without taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye thing of them. Finallye let them giue nothing vnto Southſayers, and cauſe them to liue chaſtely with their hoſtes: and whoſoeuer is author of any mutinie, let him be greeuouſly puniſhed.</p>
                     <p>And this was the contents of the letter that the ſayd Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour did write vnto his Lieutenant: which was not written vnto the Souldiers of that age to better purpoſe: then it would be neceſſary for vs at this time, at the leaſt a great part of it: nor the ſaid Emperour had neuer more need to vſe greater ſeueritie towards his Souldiers, then it is neceſſarye for vs to vſe at this daye towards ours. A man cannot ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the wante of Iuſtice, that wee haue amongſt vs: becauſe that all vices doe raigne amongſt vs, and that we do paſſe them by diſſimulation: or if that anye offender bee puniſhed, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is not ſo grieuous as it ought to bee: for wee puniſh great faultes and ſmall all alike: for as well ſhall hee bee quit with a hanging, that hath rauiſhed a woman, as hee that hath ſtolne but one loafe of bread, or anye other ſmall thing: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the puniſhments ought to bee different, for that the crimes of rauiſhing, is without compariſon, more ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and deteſtable then robbing.</p>
                     <p>I would that the ſeueritye of the ſayde <hi>Aurelian,</hi> were vſed amongſt vs: for I doe thinke that our forcers of women would then bee rudelye ynough handled, if wee would imitate his example by the puniſhment that hee did vnto one of his Souldiers that had committed adulterye with his Hoſteſſe: which woorde of adulterye dooth importe a freewill in it ſelfe, and is not to bee thought ſo haynous as forceing: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:10495:159"/>
hee cauſed him to bee ſet betwixt two high trees, and the toppes of the trees to bee bowed downe-warde, and one of his legs to be made faſt vnto the one tree, and the other vnto the other tree, and beeing ſo bounde, the trees were let goe at once, ſo that the trees ſpringing vp, pluckte him in two peeces. Which manner of Iuſtice was long after of ſuch force, that there was no Souldiers of his that durſte com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit anye offence, they were made ſo ſore afrayde with the puniſhment that was vſed vnto one poore adulterer, which vice was almoſte as much vſed at that tyme, as it is at this daye.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour <hi>Macrinus</hi> cauſed two of his Souldiers to bee put to death, after a ſtrange manner, that had raui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed their Hoſteſſe mayde: which was, hee cauſed two great Oxen to bee paunched, and put the condemned into theyr bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes, and theyr bellyes to bee ſowed vp afterwarde: and to the intent that they might ſpeake eache vnto other, hee appointed that they ſhould haue theyr heads out: ſo that theſe two offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders did rotte, and were eaten with the Vermine that engende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the fleſh, as it did corrupt: yet not ſo ſoone but that they pyned many dayes. A worthie example for all other to bee warned by.</p>
                     <p>The like puniſhments did the auncient Chiefes inuent to puniſhe the wicked that did commit offence, not onelye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe that did the like vnto the foreſayd, but alſo againſt thoſe that did ſeeke to betraye anye Towne, and ſell it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theyr enemyes, or to put anye troope of men into theyr handes, or other thinge, as it ſeemed by a certaine treaſon that diuers yoong men of <hi>Rome</hi> did practiſe to put <hi>Torquinus</hi> into theyr Cittie: who beeing diſcouered, were beheaded, with diuerſe other of theyr partakers: and amongſt others two of the Sonnes of <hi>Brutus,</hi> who being then <hi>Conſull,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the execution to bee doone vpon them.</p>
                     <p>There was likewiſe in our time certayne of thoſe traytors puniſhed, which is a thing worthye to be had in remembrance: It was when the Lorde <hi>Rans</hi> was Lieutenant for the King in
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:10495:160"/>
                        <hi>Barlette</hi> in the kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> who hauing giuen charge of the towne and Souldiers in his abſence: whilſt hee was occupied to winne certaine places vpon the mountaine of <hi>Saintange,</hi> vnto an <hi>Italian</hi> Captaine named <hi>Ieronimie</hi> of <hi>Cremone:</hi> who had ſold the ſayde Towne vnto the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that were at <hi>Andria</hi> vnder the Countie of <hi>Boeiel:</hi> which trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor being taken with his Seriant, who onely were found cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable in this treaſon: were condemned to bee hanged by the feete vntill they died. Which ſentence being executed immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly, the Seriant was hanged ouer the gate towards the ſea, and the Captaine at one of the windowes in the Caſtle. I ſaw them hanging in this manner, when I came from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Campe, with whome I was kept priſoner from our ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw at <hi>Naples,</hi> vntill I came vnto <hi>Barlette,</hi> not finding any meanes to depart ſooner.</p>
                     <p>Another like execution was doone at <hi>Thurine,</hi> by the Lord of <hi>Boutiers,</hi> vpon a traitor which brought the <hi>Spaniards</hi> into one of the Bulwarkes of the towne: ſo that if the ſayd Lord had not beene in place as he was for his great profit, the towne had beene loſt at that time: but thereby his vigilance was knowne, and that he was not a man that loued his eaſe as many others doe, when as they are appointed to keepe places that are worth the keeping.</p>
                     <p>The traitor as it was told me was drawne in peeces with foure horſſes: and hee did well deſerue to bee ſo puniſhed or worſe: conſidering the great domage that might haue inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the loſſe of the ſaide towne, which is of ſuch importance, that it were neceſſarie to haue good Cheefes in it, which ſhould be vigilant, as the ſaid Lord of <hi>Boutiers</hi> was, and as the Lord of <hi>Langey</hi> is, who dooth gouerne it at this inſtant: who cannot faile in executing of this charge any waye, for his vertues and perfect knowledge in learning and armes. I dare ſaye that hee hath a great care of the charge of the foreſayde <hi>Thurine:</hi> for our enemies haue a good will to get it from vs, and doe alwaies vſe all their indeuour: for in mine opinion it is the towne that that they doe moſt deſire in all <hi>Italie:</hi> wherefore the King ought to make a great reckoning of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="293" facs="tcp:10495:160"/>Foraſmuch as I haue ſaide before that the faultes committed by perticular perſons were puniſhed perticularly, and thoſe which the Legions did commit in Generall, were puniſhed ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally.</p>
                     <p>Hauing ſpoken of perticular puniſhment: it reſteth to ſhew how the Legions were puniſhed for the generall crime or diſorder which they did commit: whereof we haue an enſample in the life of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> who caſſierd the tenth Legion reprochfullye, becauſe they had diſobeyed him: which was a blot of infamie, that honeſt men did feare more then death: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were alwaies after repulſed and reiected from all honeſt places, after that they were once caſſierd, and were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer after ſuffered to follow the wars, nor to exerciſe any charge, nor to attaine to office or eſtate whatſoeuer it were. This maner of caſſiering of bands hath béene vſed in <hi>Prouince</hi> in our time, by the Lord Conſtable vpon parte of thoſe of the Garriſon of <hi>Arle,</hi> and by the Lord Marſhall of <hi>Montiean</hi> in <hi>Thurin:</hi> but this maner was not like in all things, becauſe that the auncient Chiefes declared theirs to be vnfit for all honeſt buſines: &amp; thoſe that the ſaid two Lords did caſſier were not ſo handled: but they may aſwell attaine vnto any office, as if they neuer had bin caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſierd. The cauſe of this caſſiering, was for a mutinie that was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted by the Souldiers of both the foreſayd townes, againſt the ſaid Lords, who preſented the king his perſon, &amp; they procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſo far, that they did enter both their lodgings forceably. We are ſo giuen vnto theſe mutinies, that there is no nation that dooth care for our companies one hower, but they had rather be farre from vs, then neare vnto vs: becauſe that we runne from one vnto another, for euery ſmall occaſion, and are haſtier to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin theſe quarrels amongſt our ſelues, then to fight with our enemies when time requireth: and theſe diſorders doe oftener happen, when as we haue our enemies neere vs then farre of: for which there muſt be ſome good order taken, and moſt ſharpe puniſhment vſed, as often as theſe mutinies doe happen, and that Souldiers do riſe againſt their Chiefes. As for the muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of perticular bandes amongſt themſelues, I would haue him layd handes vpon that were the occaſion of the mutinie, or
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:10495:161"/>
had begun it: and would haue him put to death after the maner that we are accuſtomed to puniſh mutiners at this preſent. And if ſo be that any did lay hands vpon the Captaines or Chiefes, I would haue them to bee put to ſome cruell death: as to bee buried aliue, to haue their bones broken, or to bee drawne at a Horſe taile vntill ſuch time as their bodies did fall a pieces: or haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be puniſhed in ſuch ſort, that it might be an horror and a feare vnto all others. And for to waight a time conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to laye hands vpon one of theſe mutiners, I would haue the greateſt patience that might be poſſible: and rather diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a yeare or two, then to ſuffer one mutiner to eſcape the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment that he had deſerued. And if ſo be that a whole Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had committed this offence, that there were no meanes to know the principall mutiners, there were no better way then to imitate the auncient Chiefes heerein, who tooke out the tenth man, or a great part of their people, when as the fault was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall: and this taking was doone by lot, which was an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that the puniſhment did touche but ſome certaine number, and yet they all in generall were made afraid to be of that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that the lot did condemne.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore becauſe that euery man was in daunger of this lot, they endeuoured with all their powers to doe their duties iuſtlye, fearing to beare the burthen of other mens faults. The lot likewiſe was vſed, when as the bandes or Legions did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake a place, or runne away before their enemies: for that to put a whole armie vnto death had beene too great a loſſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they tooke the tenth man, and ſometime more: and he was executed immediatlye. That which <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Souldiers, may witneſſe my ſayengs: who figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt the <hi>Voloces,</hi> fled from the battaile: for which cauſe he did put to death all the Captaines, Centeniers, Corporals, and Souldiers of his hoaſte that had loſt their armes, and the Enſigne bearers that had loſt their Enſignes, and not content with all this, hee cauſed the tenth man of the Souldiers to be put to death by lot.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> cauſed likewiſe the tenth man of certaine bandes that fled from their enemies to bee flaine. Many other
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:10495:161"/>
Chiefes haue procéeded extraordinarely in this buſines, as the one was more ſeueere then the other. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> made a lawe, that who ſo fled from a battaile, might neuer at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto office in theyr commonwealths, nor marrye theyr daughters (if that they had any) nor take wiues if they were to marry. Moreouer it was lawfull for any man that did méete them vpon the waye, to ſtrike or beate them at his pleaſure: ſo that thoſe poore miſerable creatures were ſubiect vnto blowes, and vnto a thouſand infamies, that the woorſt Cittizens might doe vnto them. And to the intent that they might bee knowne from other men, they did weare their coates of two coulours, and their beards ſhauen on the one ſide, and long on the other. If this law had béen eſtabliſhed in <hi>Fraunce</hi> during the warres which haue béene in our time, there would be more Souldiers found wearing partie couloured coates, and halfe ſhauen, then others: but let that paſſe: it might ſuffice if wee had a good will to amend our faultes for that that is to come, and to doe our endeuour from hencefoorth better then wee haue doone hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto. To be bréefe, the ſeueritie of the ancient Chiefes did not onely extend vnto the puniſhment of thoſe faultes which deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued death. But alſo they had a regard vnto thoſe faultes that were not of that importance, to the intent to leaue no fault vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed, how little ſoeuer it was, contrarie vnto the diſcipline of the warres, as their Hiſtories do make mention. Our Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſhall likewiſe take order that all the faults which his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ſhould commit, might be gréeuouſly puniſhed, how little ſoeuer they were, contrarie vnto the diſcipline of the warres, or vnto the King his ſeruice, although they were not damageble at that time that they were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, but might be afterwards. Wherfore the ſaid Generall muſt looke deeply into this matter, cauſing offenders to be puniſhed according vnto the qualitie of the offence that they did commit, hauing a regard vnto the euill that hath inſued, or the inconuenience y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> might enſue: for which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration it is neceſſary that the ſaid General ſhould be ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what cruell, if he would be well ſerued by his people; cheefely at the beginning, vntill he hath brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in order to liue wel, &amp; to that point, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they do excerciſe their faculty as it ought to be.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="296" facs="tcp:10495:162"/>And if ſo be that he himſelfe were of ſo gentle, and pittifull nature, that he would not puniſh offenders rigorouſly: yet were it neceſſarie that ſome other ſhould cauſe the puniſhment to be doone for him. For which intent I haue inſtituted before, the Iuſtice of the Legions, which maner of iuſtice he may vſe if hee will: both for to eaſe himſelfe of trouble, as alſo for not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing his wits fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his other buſines, but whether he himſelf dooth take knowledge of the offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces that his people do commit, or that he doe referre it vnto their Chiefes, thoſe that doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any heynous crime: and amongſt others, the one of them that I haue named before, ought to be extraordinarily puniſhed. And to the intent that theſe wicked offenders might bee puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed according vnto their deſarts, and that the example might withdraw others from dooing the like: it were neceſſarie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe ſome new torment, to puniſh them with the moſt terribleſt death that might be inuented. And if ſo be that any man will ſaye that a Captaine Generall ought to bee mercifull, and not ſuch a one as I would haue him, I doe aunſwer, that to execute Iuſtice is no crueltie, but to giue euery one his hyer, vnto the good all good things, and vnto the wicked theyr reward: for euen as we hold it for a moſt ſure opinion, that good men cannot be ſo well eſtéemed or rewarded, but that they doe deſerue much more: ſo likewiſe we may ſay by thoſe that are wicked, that it is impoſſible to puniſh them ſo gréeuouſly, but that they doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue a great deale worſe. Me thinkes that whoſoeuer dooth betraye his Prince, in what manner ſoeuer it bee, or dooth faile to performe the principall pointes of the arte of the warres: or generally any other that may bee an occaſion of the ſlacking of his ſeruice: that is to ſay, if he doe hinder it willingly, and erre wilfully, ſuch ought to be tormented after the moſt cruelleſt ſort that may be deuiſed: &amp; that Generall y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhould haue ſuch people in his hoaſt, ought to put them to death with one of the torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts aboueſaid, without mercy or pardon. And although hee ſhould be coumpted to be cruell, for vſing of ſuch rigour, yet ſhould not this tittle withdraw him from dooing his endeuour, but good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will not blame him, but eſteeme him the more, &amp; beſides their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimation, the blame of the wicked is a thing not to be accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:10495:162"/>
of at all. Moreouer, hee ſhalbe enforced to doe ſo, if hee haue a great number in charge, whether that they be all of one nation, or of diuers: for except that he be feared, &amp; accompted to be ſuch a one, he ſhall neuer kéepe his hoaſt in quiet, nor haue haue them readie &amp; willing at al howres to obey him.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt all the great acts, for which <hi>Anniball</hi> is renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, I finde one to be the chiefeſt: that is, that he hauing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his conduct a very great army compounded of diuers nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, did gouerne them ſo well, that he neuer had one onely mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunie in his camp, although they were of ſtraunge countries, &amp; did ſometimes win, and ſometimes looſe: which is a thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to be remembred. The occaſion of the maintaining of his armie in this peace, in mine opinion, was the vnnaturall cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which he did vſe, which together with his vertues, made him alwaies to be reuerenced and feared of his ſouldiers: but with out his ſeueritie: his good qualities would haue done him as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſeruice as <hi>Scipio</hi> his did him: who although hee was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted to be one of the moſt vertuous men that euer was: yet for that he was no waies cruell, but the readieſt man to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don that euer was ſéene, his lenitie ſo bouldened his ſouldiers to mutunie in <hi>Spayne</hi> againſt the chiefes, and to rebell. His great pitie another time, was cauſe of the deſtruction of thoſe of <hi>Locres,</hi> and that many murthers were committed amongſt his owne people. So that it appeareth, that lenitie, &amp; pity are not profitable for a Chiefe that will be obayed of his ſouldiers, and that crueltie is more neceſſary for him. But becauſe that this word, is ſomewhat odious, I will terme it ſeuerity, &amp; will ſay that a Lieuetenant Generall that doth pretend to doo good ſeruice: ought to be as ſeuere as is poſſible. And if ſo be that he doe not puniſhe ſo rigorouſly, as is aforeſaide, yet at the leaſte he ſhould ſuffer no fault to ſcape vnpuniſhed: for in ſo doing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man will indeuour to doe well, and feare to offend ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no offence ſhalbe borne withall. And if I were aſked whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were better for a Generall to be feared, then loued of his people, or to be beloued then feared: I would anſwere, that he ought to doe his indeuour to bee both, if it were poſſible. But for that it is hard that feare and loue ſhould bee alied together,

I ſay that it is much more ſurer to be feared, then to be beloued, if that he might not be both: foraſmuch as we doe ſee that ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours are generally ingratefull, variable, deceiptfull, doe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly eſchue perill and couet gaine, &amp; whilſt that they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for and that there is no great neede of them, they doe ſay that they are ready to ſerue, and to be wholly at the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Chiefes: but when it dooth come vnto the puſhe that they muſt be put to their buſines, then they do faine them ſelues ſicke, or ſtart away, or doe finde ſome forged excuſe to bee exempted from their ſeruice: ſo that if there be no other meane to induce them to doe their indeuour, the accoumpt may bee made that they will doe nothing of them ſelues. Which other meanes muſt rather bee for the loue that they doe beare vnto their Generall, becauſe that all men haue leaſt regarde to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him who maketh him ſelfe to be beloued, then him that maketh him ſelfe to be feared: for bicauſe that loue is held by a certaine bond of obligation, which is ſoone broken by thoſe men who doe loue their perticuler profits, more then their honeſties: of which ſorte the moſt parte of ſouldiers are at this day. But feare is held of a doubt to incurre the puniſhment which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for euery fault, which feare doth neuer leaue thoſe that doe their indeuour by force.</p>
                     <p>But a Generall muſt make him ſelfe to bee ſo feared, that if hee could not get the loue of his ſouldiers, yet at the leaſt hee ſhould not make him ſelfe to be hated by them. For theſe two things may well agree together, to wit, to be feared, and not to bee hated. With which meane the Lord of <hi>Lautrec</hi> helped him ſelfe as well as any Generall that was before him or ſince: for he was ſo feared of his men with out hatred, that euery man doubted to diſobay him: many examples thereof were ſeene in many places, but ſpecially vpon Eaſter day a litle from <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> where his Camp was in ſuch a mutunie one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that there was neither Colonells, nor Captaine Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls that could appeaſe them, or keepe them from beginning a warre amongſt themſelues, not vnlike to haue made a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous medley, if the ſayd Lord had not gone betwixt them to parte them: which hee did with ſo litle difficultie, that aſſoone
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:10495:163"/>
as hee was ariued there was no ſtroke ſtriken, nor man that kept his place: but they vaniſhed ſodainely out of his preſence ſome one way ſome another, hee neither beating nor ſtriking any man: but onely for the feare that euery man had to doe ought that might diſpleaſe him. And in truth hee did all with his Souldiers that hee would doe, for which cauſe hee ſtroke them not: knowing that to bee common and familier with euery man (although that this familiarity in getting y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fauour and loue of men) might bee an occaſion to emboulden them to offend ſooner then if hee ſhewed himſelfe to bee ſtraunge and ſeuere: conſidering moreouer, that although hee made him ſelfe to be feared of his Souldiers, that he was not therefore to be hated of them: but alſo furthermore he loſt nothing by ſhewing him ſelfe to be ſuch a none as hee woulde haue his Souldiers for to bee. Moreouer, if there were occaſion to put any man to death, the cauſe being iuſt, hee deferred it not: ſo that things were handled by him, that hee was not to bee reprooued.</p>
                     <p>In like manner muſt our Generall lyue with his people, and to haue that excellencie in him, to make him ſelfe to be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and feared.</p>

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:10495:164"/>
and which haue patiently borne the burden of the warres, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time that the king his pleaſure was to bee ſerued by them. For there is nothing more iuſt then where offenders are greatly puniſhed, that wel deſeruers ſhould be well rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: if ſo be that we would haue men to hope, and feare all at once. For which cauſe the <hi>Romans</hi> did ordaine a certaine recompence for euery vertuous acte: to weete, for him that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued any citizens life, fighting againſt his enemies: likewiſe, vnto him that got vp firſt vpon a wall, or that entred firſt at a breache, or into his enemtes Forte: likewiſe, for him that in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſally out of a towne beſieged, did firſt paſſe his enemies tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: in ſumme, euery vertuous acte was remembred, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced by the <hi>Conſuls:</hi> and moreouer, praiſed publikely of euery man. And beſides the honour &amp; good fame that thoſe that did obtaine thoſe gifts did get amongſt other ſouldiers, they might weare them amongſt the citizens, and goe to and fro with them, and none other durſt weare the like, but onely thoſe which had gotten them by the way aboueſaide. I will not ſtay to tell what gifts they were, nor whereof the garmentes were that were giuen them: for it is inough that the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence was good: and although it was not riche, yet it was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable. The King had ordained that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Legionaries which did any acte of valour ſhould haue certaine gould rings giuen them: and that order had beene very good if it had beene kept. I would likewiſe, that thoſe of whom I treat here, ſhould haue vppergarments, or rings, or bracelets, or Iewels, I doe not care what they were, ſo that they might ſerue for tokens and ſhewes vnto the world, that thoſe that did weare them had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued them ſelues like vnto men of vertue. Moreouer, they might enioy the Priuiledges and other freedomes which the lawes of Emperours doe permit, and alſo the Prerogatiues which the auncient Souldiers did enioy amongſt the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Romans.</hi> The King might likewiſe exempt them from taxes, and though not from all, yet at the leaſt from parte. And if ſo be that he conquered any country or towne by force of armes, hee might people them with thoſe ſouldiers that had taken paines to doe him ſeruice, and banniſhe the other inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunts
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:10495:164"/>
as I haue ſaide before: or place them amongſt the firſt inhabitaunts, if the ſaid towne &amp; countrie were able to receiue them all.</p>
                     <p>The orders of the Legions doe import that thoſe that haue bene maymed of their limmes in the king his ſeruice, ſhould be put into Garriſons &amp; be kept there as the other dead paies were, and the recompence is honeſt. But for that it is not only inough to recompence maimed men, &amp; to forget others that haue ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them ſelues to be honeſt men, although that they were not maymed, for I am of opinion that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king ſhould make accompt of all thoſe that had ſerued him faithfully in his warres, and ſhould be informed of euery man his deſerts, to the intent that he him ſelfe might cut their bread, and not a <hi>quidam,</hi> whom the matter doth not touch at all, and who will paſſe it lightly: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it bee the Generall that hath had them in charge, or ſome other that doth know their deſerts, which to doe well muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute here one thing and there another, according vnto eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man his valour and merite, whether they bee places of dead payes, keeping of Caſtles, Captaine ſhippes, Baliages, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoſties, Steward-ſhippes, or other courtlike offices: and if ſo be that thoſe offices and eſtates may not ſuffice, the king hath wherewithall to recompence them richly by penſion or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: at the vttermoſt there are many gouernments in <hi>France,</hi> which may be charged to maintaine a great number. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, the Prelats &amp; great benefices of <hi>France</hi> might be charged to maintaine another parte, with the third penny of their reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes which they are bound to imploy for the maintenance of the poore, but they doe it not: wherefore it would be labour well ſpent to make them to be charitable, that will not be ſo of them ſelues. And this I meane for the recompencing of ſimple ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers &amp; pore gentlemen: as for the Chiefs, they may be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced with the offices and eſtats aboueſaide. If that ſouldiers did hope to be recompenced honeſtly when as the warres were ended, &amp; to liue without feare of pouerty: it is a thing moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that whilſt they are in the wars they would incline them ſelues to no other thing, but to do the king good ſeruice: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they are conſtrained before all things to thinke vpon their perticuler profit, and afterward to exerciſe their facultie. But
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:10495:165"/>
God knoweth howe, for wee doe ſee, that who ſo doth not win by his induſtrie, doth looſe his time in tarrying vntill that an other doe geue him any thing: and that is alſo the occaſion that ſouldiers at this day doe vſe the warres for their occupation, &amp; not to the intent to doe the Prince ſeruice that doth giue them their wages. Wherefore, when as the warres doe fayle, there are fewe ſouldiers that will labour or worke againe at the occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation that they did learne in their youth: and then, if they haue nothing to maintaine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to liue idlely, they do become robbers &amp; ſkouters vpon wais, as <hi>Montclou</hi> his men did, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the like haue done in <hi>France,</hi> ſince the king his raigne.</p>
                     <p>I ſpeake nothing of the ſubtleties that they doe vſe, nor of the deſire that they haue of the continuance of the warre, nor what enemies they are vnto the peace, nor how they doe ſeeke many inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tions to delay the king his ſeruice, which they would not doe, if that they had any hope to be recompenced.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, I doe ſay that who ſo ſhall leuie ſouldiers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the maner before ſpoken of in this booke, and ſhall vſe the obſeruations of puniſhment, and rewarde aboueſaide towardes thoſe that through their good, or ill déeds had deſerued praiſe or blame, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould haue as good ſouldiers as euer were. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there muſt be no doubt made: for I dare affirme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theſe here ſpoken of are in all points ſo well ordred, as any ſouldiers were ſince that the <hi>Romans</hi> were in their triumph: and to prooue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is ſo, who ſo dooth looke into it, ſhall find that they are firſt of all leuied and choſen according vnto true election, &amp; beſides ſo well armed &amp; weaponed (that in mine opinion) there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be founde fault with all. Moreouer, the deſtribution of them vnto bands and officers, doth agrée partly with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ancient maner, and partly with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maner y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is now vſed: beſides, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ranging them is borrowed of both: ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what maner ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ancient <hi>Romans</hi> did vſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was better then ours, &amp; that which we haue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is better then theirs, hath bin here in obſerued: and as for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> number if it be thought to bee too ſmall, I doe not ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is forbidden to make it greater, whether it were of foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men or horſemen. But I am well aſſured y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ordnary hoaſt of a <hi>Roman</hi> Conſall, was not ſo great of Citizens, &amp; alliance as theſe before ſpoken of: neither is that much greater which <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getius</hi>

inſtituteth, if ſo be y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they be not equal all things comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and yet the <hi>Romaines</hi> helped themſelues againſt the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of their aduerſaries, with their ſmall number, except when as they had to deale with a mighty enemy, and then they did put two Conſuls hoaſtes together: and then if their number amounted vnto 50000. <hi>Romanes,</hi> Allies &amp; Voluntaries, that came without commandment, it was a whole world. Sith then they did augment their number at their neede, what ſhall let vs to leuie as many as we will, hauing men enow as well as they had, if it were 50000. or 100000. if it were requiſit? but this great leuie may be reſerued vntill an extreamity, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aboueſaid fower legions might ſerue for a warre of meane importance: to wit, if wee were to encounter but with 30000. or 40000. ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. For I do make arcount, that the order that is vſed in this ſmall number is more worth then an enemy that hath fifteen or twenty thouſand more. And if ſo be that wee did leuie any ſmall number more then theſe, they might ſerue for ſuddaine courſes, and ſkirmiſhes, and to put into garriſons in conquered townes: as for a daye of battaile, theſe fower legions with their accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhmentes, may doe as good ſeruice as if they were a greater number, for peraduenture a greater number would make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, as great multitudes are accuſtomed to doe, for that they cannot ſo well be ordred as a meaner number. <hi>Pirrhus</hi> the king of the <hi>Epirotes,</hi> vſed to ſaye that hee would haue but 15000. onely to fight againſt all men. The ſmall number of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> his ſouldiers do verify his words, which number being wel ordred, were more woorth then <hi>Darius</hi> great multitude ill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, I doe thinke that I haue ſo well aduertiſed the Generall that might haue the conduct of this people of ſo many points, that if he doe leeſe any thing, or doe not bring his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes to a good end, it ſhalbe his own negligence that wil hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him and not the want of aduertiſement of anye thing that might ſerue his turne: for I haue ſhewed him how he ſhal take leaſt hurt, and haue taught him how to giue battaile, and to get the victorie. Moreouer, I haue ſhewed him what might happen during y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> combat, or after, &amp; the way to remedy inconueniences.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="304" facs="tcp:10495:166"/>Conſequently, I haue led him through his enemies ſo ſure, that he was not to bee ſurprized, and haue made mention of the inconueniences that may happen vnto an hoaſt, marching by the way: afterward I haue lodged him ſo ſtrongly incamped, that he might reſt with his people without feare of any man. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, he hath bin taught diuers pollicies for to ouercome his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are left after a bataile: &amp; what order ought to be obſerued in the beſiedging of a town. Moreouer I haue giuen him laws to helpe him ſelfe withall, for to haue good ſeruice of the people vnder his charge; and therwith haue ſhewed him how he might proceede in his iudgementes for to condemne or releaſe a priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Finally, I haue inferred at the taile of theſe thinges before ſpoken of: certaine examples of the ſeueritie that the auncient Chiefes did vſe, when as they did puniſhe any crimes of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce: of all which there hath bin ſo largely ſpoken, that as I haue tired my ſelfe in writing them, ſo I doubt that thoſe that ſhall throughly peruſe them, will be weary themſelues in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them. What reſteth now then, but to conclude, that who ſo would put this leauy in practiſe ſhould make his Souldiers the moſt excellentſt men of war that haue bin ſince the <hi>Romanes:</hi> which is ſo eaſie a matter to be inſtituted in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and to be maintained, that nothing is more eaſie. If it had pleaſed God that the leuieng of our legions had bene like it: for it might bee thought that the king would haue liked them ſo well, that hee would not haue changed or releaſed them, for to haue bin ſerued with ſtrangers, or aduenturers as he hath done: &amp; yet I hope he wil remember himſelfe, &amp; make his wars with his own people. But ſuppoſe that he doth reiect the legions, &amp; that the order ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in this worke, be not worthy to be receiued: yet I do hope ſhortly to ſee, that Militarye Diſcipline ſhall bee reſtored vnto her auncient force by the ſayd Lorde, and through the diligence that you my Lorde <hi>Conſtable</hi> will imploy before all other, both for your office ſake, and alſo for that I do thinke that you were ordained for to deliuer vs from the ſeruitude of ſtrangers, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we haue bene long time, who may vaunt that they haue bene the diſpoſers of all the warres that wee haue made within thys 30. yeares, and haue made vs to léeſe as often as it pleaſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:10495:166"/>
for in truth all our hope and truſt conſiſted, and it lay in theyr hands for to defend or to deſtroy vs, but I am in good hope that through the good order that you will take, that we ſhall no more héereafter be at their mercy: which opinion, both <hi>Frenchmen</hi> and ſtrangers haue of you, grounding their argument vppon that which you haue begun, in ſhewing the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> way how to reſiſt all their enemies. And moreouer becauſe that you haue begun to reforme the ſtate of the horſemen not long ſince, it is thought that you will not leaue the footemen in their accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed errour, ſpecially for that the horſſemen had not ſo great néede of reformation as the footemen. Beſides, it is not ſo requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to haue good horſſemen, as good footemen, for the footemen are they that may winne or léeſe a battaile, and not the horſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, except that it be by a great chaunce. I am aſſured that you putting your helping hand vnto this worke, ſhall be well aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by many good and auncient Captaines, who do vnderſtand this buſines better then I can expreſſe it. And moreouer, there are my Lords the Marſhals, and ſo many other to helpe, that it would be impoſſible if the matter were once ſet abroach, and put in queſtion, but that it would haue good ſucceſſe: and for to make the matter the more eaſy, this realme is ſo well furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with experimented, wiſe, and wellwilling men, that there wanteth nothing to ſet vp this arte incontinent, but the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them aworke, and ſhewing them the manner how to exerciſe thoſe ſmall things that appertaine therevnto: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no more to do but to make a leuy of men after the manner that I haue ſhewed, or after a better, and immediatly to commit them vnto the charge of thoſe that are fitteſt, and do beſt vnderſtand this buſines for to traine them: and if the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were ſo handled, you may be ſure (as you do well vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d) that this diſcipline well exerciſed, would reſtore vs vnto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation that we haue loſt through our negligence, and beſides that, you ſhould get an immortall fame for your trauell. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer my Lord, if I did not knowe the great affection that you haue borne of long time vnto this reformation, I would enforce my ſelf to perſwade you therevnto at this inſtant, but knowing that it would be but foliſhly done of me to trouble you with a
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:10495:167"/>
matter that you ſo greatly deſire, I wil but only remember you for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpéedy effecting of your deſire, to the intent that we might yet one day haue amongſt vs the manner, valew, &amp; aduantage that a well ordered hoaſt hath aboue an hoaſt that is ill ordered, to do vs ſeruice chiefely againſt the enemies of our faith, if ſo bee that the King would take any voyage in hand againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as euery man hopeth that he will do, or if ſo be that he would attend vntil that they ſhould aſſaile vs at home, as it is to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that they will doe, if that our Lord GOD doe not put to his helping hand, which were a thing very néedfull for vs: as for vs to thinke that we could reſiſt them with our accuſtomed manner of warre, we ſhould deceiue our ſelues, ſéeing they do farre excell vs in power &amp; diſcipline, and except we do reforme our naughty manner of liuing, it were nothing, for euery man knoweth that they are the iuſt ſcourge of God, by whome he will puniſh vs for the grieuous faults which we do commit. But this amendment will be found to be a hard matter with thoſe that are accuſtomed to liue at their owne pleaſures, and yet it is nothing elſe but the cuſtome that we haue taken in it: notwithſtanding the firſt is eaſie, if ſo be that we would take a little paines in it, and the laſt is not impoſſible, if that we would imitate the Lord <hi>Camille Vrſin,</hi> who hath ſo well amended and reformed the <hi>Italyans</hi> that are vnder his charge, for the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> in <hi>Slauony</hi> (whoſe manner of liuing before was too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt corrupt, as it is well knowne that of all the nations that do haunt the warres, there is none ſo excéeding vitious as the <hi>Italyans</hi> are commonly) that of ſuch as I ſay they were, he hath brought them into ſo good order, that the worſt amongſt them may be compared with any of the beſt religious that we haue in our Monaſteries. And to ſay truth it is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miracle of our time, for both the act which he hath done, and the victories they haue gotten, may rightly be tearmed to be wonders. I do ſay that our men are neither of ſtéele nor ſtone more then his were, but that they may be brought vnto a maner of good life aſwell as they, ſo that we had another <hi>Camille</hi> amongſt vs, or that the Captains who ſhould haue the charge of theſe men, would do their indeuour to imitate him as néere as they might, and for

this cauſe haue I made mention of him in this place, as alſo to ſhew that it would not be impoſſible to reforme a great many of our ſouldiers, to wéet, thoſe that are leaſt hurtfull, ſo that euery one of the Chiefes would firſt reforme himſelfe for his owne part, and moreouer did proceed in his buſines for another and better intent, then they do that go to the warres at this day. But I now go without my bounds, and in ſtead of diſpatching, do intangle my ſelfe further then euer before, and do borrowe a new occaſion for euill ſpeakers to reproue me, ſpecially for that I do ſpeake of matters at my owne pleaſure, willing this and that to be done, as if it were in me to appoint, or that I were better then other men, which I am not, and therefore it is the worſſe: wherefore not to detaine you longer with words, nor to wéery you with rehearſals, which I do feare more, then the toongs of thoſe that would cut me through, I wil take my hand from this worke for it is time, beſieching you my Lord <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable</hi> to take my defence in hand againſt thoſe that will after diuers manners controule this Booke, and will make their laughing ſtock of it in your preſence, reprouing here one thing, and there another, as the moſt part of people do at this day whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as any new thing doth light into their hands, chiefely if it do come from the forge of any one that is of their acquaintance, or of their profeſſion, as I am ſure that more then foure that are about you will do, who would be very ſory, if they ſhould not ſpeake their rablement rather in euill part then in good, if there ſhould be any of theſe of whome I ſpeake, I appeale from their iudgement from henceforth, and at this inſtant vnto you, for to mainteine my right, I do caſt in their teethes the honeſt deſire y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I long time haue had to do or to wright ſomewhat y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> might pleaſe you, which hath moued me to take this matter in hand, as a thing moſt agreeable vnto you: and therfore ſith it is you who haue cauſed me to take this worke in hand, there is no reaſon that you ſhould excuſe me of the fault that I haue committed in it, or contrarily, that I ſhould defende mine innocencie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all thoſe find faults that would wrongfully reprooue me, whome it ſhall pleaſe you to forbidde, not to enter into the reading of thys worke for to diſpute, nor to correcte

my ſayings, except they haue written better of this matter then I haue done, or that you do eſtéeme them to be of the number of thoſe that haue perfect knowledge in militarie diſcipline, for I do conſent and permit all thoſe with a good will to reproue me fréely, and to teare out at their pleaſure all that they do finde to be ill penned, and contrary vnto their opinion: and it ſhall be ſo farre from me to be diſpleaſed for any thing that they ſhall blot or teare out of the booke, were it a great part or all, as if I might knowe their names, I would giue them thanks, and alſo accoumpt my ſelfe to be greatly beholding vnto them for the honour they had done me, in declaring their opinions vpon a matter of ſo ſmall valew.

It may be alſo that ſome may be euill conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becauſe that I haue ſpoken againſt aduentures, in blaming their leuy, and alſo their manner of life, yet I do thinke I haue done well, and whether I haue reproued them iuſtly or no, I do referre me vnto your iudgement, who knowes of what va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lewe they are, and who is not to learne now what fault he doth commit that doth ſerue himſelfe with them, and ſhall do, vntill ſuch time as there be a leuy of people made in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto a true election, with whome a Lieutenant Generall might ſerue himſelfe euery way better, then with others. But how ſhould you my Lord make our aduenturers to carry more harneſſe then they are accuſtomed, and to carry victuals at their backs, and tooles to rampare withall, ſith they are ſo nyce, as to make their Pages (when they are ranged in battaile) to carry their Pikes, or Harquebuſſe, or their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp; ſometime do breake their Pikes to be excuſed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> carying the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; had rather caſt their harnes into a ditch, then to lade their perſons. When can you put into their heads y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ought ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily to do the duties of Pioners, ſith at a néed they will do no thing, but driue away thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> do rampare of their own frée wils. If in a great number there were one found, they do deſpiſe him,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:10495:168"/>
and flye from him as they would do from one that were excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated or infected, and deſpiſe him as we do vaine and ydle men. How will you keepe them euery day certaine houres in armes for to exerciſe them in fayned battailes, for to bee better ſerued of them at the combat, then if they had not béen exerciſed: ſith that if there bee queſtion that they ſhould watch but once in fifteene daies, or ſhould be ſent but vnto one extraordinarie ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice once in a moneth, they will murmur againſt you, ſaying that they are ouercharged, and that it is for drudges to do the ſeruice they do. I ſpeake nothing of the brauer ſort, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine to be found at ſuch like ſeruices, becauſe they can renounce God more outragiouſly then others, or for that they are more richly clad. How will you bring them to vſe any extreame dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence on foote, that onely for martching of one mile, they muſt mount on horſebacke at the departing from their lodging: ſo that a ſmall band of footmen at this preſent do carrie as great a trayne of horſes, as a great companie of horſemen were wont to do: or if they do any diligence on foote, they muſt haue more intreaties and perſwaſions, then I could reſite in a whole day. And ſometimes they muſt be vſed with threatning and force, ſo that I may ſay, that all the good that they do, if peraduenture they do any, is by force, and that they neuer make warre of their free-willes. When will they abſtaine from play, from whores, and from blaſpheming, and from committing thoſe inſolencies y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they do euery day, aſwell againſt friend, as againſt enemies? Or for to keepe them from it, how great a labour ſhould you haue, and how many men ſhould you put to death? how will it be poſſible to reduce them to that manner of life, that a plum-tree laden with plummes, being within one of the Campes that wée do make, might be found after that wee are diſlodged, vndiminiſhed, without any man laying hand vpon it (as we do reade in times paſt hath béen) when as the very ſacred things are not ſure in Churches, for that they pill all, nor the things of thoſe that lodge together is not quiet: for they robbe one from another he that beſt may beſt. Shall I make mention of the countrie where they paſſe, ſith it were as good to bee conſumed
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:10495:169"/>
with fire, as to abide the paſſage of this people, for that they leaue neither riffe nor raffe, but do force, and murther as well the women as the men they can lay hold vpon. I ſay in ſumme, that it is a ſort of people that are not to bee corrected, who ſo ſhall looke well into them, ſo that there is neither Captaine nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that can deale with them: for if a Captaine would take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their libertie from doing euill, they will ſay that he reapeth ſome profite vnder hand: if he reprooue them, they do the worſe, or they abandon him: if he puniſh them, they mutin, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times reuenge vpon his perſon. But how will they amend for him, when as a Captaine Generall himſelfe, can hardly take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for it? Will they do any thing for that they are of their Captaines countrie? No, for they are not his ſubiects, no nor he knoweth not poſſible the tenth man but by ſight: wherefore if they flye after that they haue done any offence, he ſhall not knowe in what place to finde them, for to puniſh them. And ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that they muſt bee found, it is ſo that the Captaines muſt purſue them at their owne charges, which is not for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite: for peraduenture they ſhall ſpend their monie in vayne, for to do that which Iuſtice is bound to do. And furthermore, do theſe Captaines thinke to make their men refraine by putting them to any ſhame, ſith they are borne and nurſſed without euer hauing learned any other thing then ſhame? What ſhall they promiſe them being at the wars, whereby their Souldiers may be enticed or bound with all reuerence to loue and feare them: ſith that when as the warres are ended, they ſhall haue no more to do with them, and before the ende, one will go on the one ſide, and another on the other. Wherefore ſhould Souldiers be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient vnto their Captaines, if they knowe not one another? What others ſhal they take? ſhall it be by our Lord, ſeeing they do deceiue him euery way, and blaſpheme ſo curſedly? ſhall it be by their parts of Paradiſe? and they haue no portion in it, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they are full of iniuſtice, fornication, malice, wickednes, manſlaughter, quarrels, fraude, euill courage, murmurers, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracters, haters of God, iniurious, proud, vaunters, inuenters of euilles, diſobedient vnto father and mother, vnto the King,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:10495:169"/>
and Superiours: without vnderſtanding, except it be to do miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, and all the reſt that followeth: all which are baniſhed from the ſight of God, as the deuill is baniſhed out of Paradiſe. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, I beleeue that ſuch people wil neuer keepe that which they haue promiſed in his name, whome they diſpraiſe at all houres? How were it poſſible that they that diſpraiſe God, ſhould reuerence men? For it is ſo that thoſe of whom I ſpeake, do make leſſe accompt of him then nothing, and not only they, but alſo the ſtraunge Souldiers that the King doth keepe in his ſeruice, or the greateſt part of them. What good order then may be taken in this matter? Certainly my Lord (you will aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere me) none: but who would haue ſimple and plaine men, ſo that they were the Kings ſubiects, whom it were farre better to take into ſeruice, ſuppoſing that they were leuied, and choſen as appertaineth, albeit that they neuer had been at any ſeruice, and that they do come but from houlding of the plough; then thoſe that had long time exerciſed the occupation of armes; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be alſwell experimented as they might be, ſo that they were otherwiſe ill conditioned: for that you ſhall finde that it is eaſier to make ſimple and newe men good Souldiers, then it is to bring the wicked to good waies, after that they are once gone aſtray. It is not then without cauſe, that I praiſe the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie of thoſe that may bée made good Souldiers with little diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie, and that I crye againſt thoſe which are ſo excéeding wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that there is not almoſt any remedie to amend them. And therefore it were not conuenient that my ſayings ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſed nor condemned, if I haue ſpoken againſt the wicked: for my meaning was to prick them only, and no others: nor it were no reaſon that I ſhould bee reproued, although I haue blamed the manner that wee do vſe in leuying Aduenturers: for I haue not done it before I had iuſtly praiſed: to weet, whether the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gionaries or the ſaid voluntaries were better: nor before regard taken diligently vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> profite that may come of the one, &amp; vnto the inconueniences and euils of which the others are commonly cauſers: for if I had made any compariſon on mine owne ſide, I would neuer bee ſo raſh, as to put it to iudgement as I do. But bee it that thoſe that doe maintaine their part, ſhould finde
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:10495:170"/>
mine opinion euill, and the libertie I haue vſed in ſpeaking: yet will I not therefore leaue to exhort al thoſe that vſe the warres, and doe delight to haue the title of Aduenturers, that they ſhould chaunge for ſome other maner that ſhould be better, then that which we haue handled hetherto: and that of euill liuers as we are, euery man ſhould beſtowe his labour to become a man of good life: and if wee haue béen inexpert in the feates of armes heretofore, let vs endeuour to reforme our ſelues hereafter in ſuch ſort, that the King ſeeing vs to bee well conditioned and perfect good Souldiers, may thinke himſelfe happie: ſpecially finding ſuch Souldiers to be in his realme, that our enemies or neighbours who daylie raunſack vs, being aduertiſed of our va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, ſhould make greater difficultie to mooue warre againſt the ſayd Lord to morrowe or next day, then they are accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: or to hould themſelues at too high a price, if he had need of the ayd of his ſayd neighbours, knowing how much we do excell them in vertue and diſcipline.</p>

In placing of which Fortreſſes, two things are chiefely to be conſidered of, the neceſſitie, and the ſcituation: for as a Forte not placed where it were néedefull, might ſkantly be accompted for frontier; ſo hauing no benefit of

Moreouer the ground in plaines is good to make ramperts of, and eaſie for cariage, but where water water wanteth, the building is coſtly and chargeable, for that a Fort ſcituated in a dry playne, muſt haue déepe ditches, high walles, great bulwarks, large ramparts, and caualieros: beſides, it muſt be great to lodge fiue or ſixe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, and haue great place in it for them to fight, ranked in battaile.

For which conſideration, the fortifier ſhall be oftentimes conſtrained to make the Fort grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then it were néedfull it ſhould be, and ofttimes with great circuit of wall ſhall encloſe but a ſmall ſuperficies of ground; but being ſo placed, it néedeth no great place in it, nor royall defences, as great Bullwarks, Flanks, or Ramparts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it will not be ſubiect vnto batterie, but will be aſſured through the valley and hanging of the hill, which will giue an enemy trouble in lodging, trenching, taking away the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, batterie, and aſſault, and being myned, the effect might happen to little proffit, for the inequalitie of the ground.

Or if the defenders ſhould be enforced to retire, they might do it with aduantage ynough, hauing moſt commonly a higher ground to repaire vnto, but when that choiſe may not be had, but that the ſuperficies of the hill top be more then the Fort may occupy, then muſt he chooſe the higher part of the hill, placing the Fort, that ſo great part of it may enioy the benefit of the hanging of the hill as poſſible may, and towarde the other part of the ſame, build as in a dry playne, for as part in reſpecte of the valley vnder it may enioy the benefite of the hilly ſcituation, ſo part in reſpect af the equalitie of the ground without it, vppon which an enemy may lodge, trenche, myne, batter, and aſſault (eſpecially if the grounde may be broken with Spade, Pickaxe, and ſuch like) is ſubiect to all thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities that a Fort ſcituated in a dry plaine.</p>
                     <p>A Fort ſcituated among Mountaines, can hardly be kept be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged with fortes, men, horſſe, and artillerie: but thoſe fortes that are ſcituated vpon hills and mountaines are troubleſome to make for the difficultie of bringing of ſtuffe to the place, are ſubiect to ſurprize, ſuffer oft times great penurie of water, and oft times are troubled with great raynes, which ſéeking

                     <p>A Fort ſcituated in a lake, néedeth no great defences: as great bulwarks, ramparts, caualieros, nor large flanks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is frée from batterie and aſſault, but through the euill aire of the lake, it will oft times be beſieged of it ſelfe. Beſides, an enemy may eaſily beſiege it, in placing Forts where it hath recourſe to the land, and procéede on hys voyage, aſſuring himſelfe that the Fort muſt come into his hands, for as it is hard to be aborded; ſo it is to receiue ſuccour, and able to do an enemy but little hurt.</p>
                     <p>Of Forts placed vppon ſmall riuers, is ſufficiently ſpoken before, and thoſe that ſtand vpon great riuers, may partly be compared with thoſe in lakes, but where they may be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, their defences muſt be great, are free of the infectiue aire which the lake oft times yéeldeth, may better receiue ſuccour, and giue an enemy great trauell in the aſſiege.</p>
                     <p>A Fort ſcituated in the Sea, is not only free from batterie and aſſault, becauſe the batterie that may be made at Sea is feeble, weake, and vncertayne, by reaſon of the Seas conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall motion; but alſo is free from beſieging, not only for that thoſe enemyes are fewe that can put any great armye to Sea: but alſo becauſe the Winde and Seas alteration is ſuch, that an Aſſige at Sea cannot be continued.

But for the foundation of a Fort, if the ſame be to be made in a fenne, mariſh, or other ſuch like grounds, which of themſelues are not able to beare the waight of the wall and rampier that ſhall be raiſed vpon them; lay a trauers of trees in the bottome of the foundation of Okes, or other wood, which will longeſt continue good in the earth, laying them thwart wiſe in the work the one faſt and cloſe ſhut to the other, and hanging ſomewhat inward toward the center of the Fort.

And as for the paſſage from one flanke vnto another, that may bee left vnuaulted, and the walles of it raiſed as high as the ſuperficies of the rampier, and couered ouer with timber. At which may a retrenchment bée made when need requireth, and the ſame well flanked, as by the manner of the lining of it in the figure before going is to bee ſeene. The rampier muſt be raiſed ſcarping, battering, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in, for euery one foot of height one foot of ſcarpe: but that part toward the Cullion muſt be raiſed flatter then the reſt, and that within the flanke or caſemate need not to bee raiſed altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo flat, and it muſt be of earth only without any faggot, that it may the better cloſe and ſettle together. And the reaſon why this rampier is ſo high and farre diſtant from the edge of the wall, is, that the whole fortreſſe might from euery part of it the better offend an enemie, and as a caualier commaund, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne ouer any thing an enemie might put in practiſe before it. And that alſo the wall being battered, this yet might ſtand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceable for a retreate. (but note, that to eaſe the charge that the carrying of this great maſſe of earth would coſt, the ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier vpon the Curtins need not to be raiſed ſo high as that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Bulwarkes: neither if the Fort do ſtand well watered need the face of the Curtin to be raiſed with brick or ſtone higher then three or foure foote aboue the water: but from thence vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rampier muſt be raiſed to his full heighth. Theſe things may be done for ſparing of charges, but perfection were better) Vpon which rampier muſt a parapet bée rayſed of 20. foot thicke vpon the Bulwarke, and ten foote vppon the Curtin: for this order would be obſerued in the parapet. Where Artillerie is to be vſed of neceſſitie in a permanent place, as in a flanke, vpon a caualier, platforme, or Bulwarke; there almoſt no thicknes of parapet is to be thought ſufficient, ſo that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place will permit it. But vpon a Curtin which is extended wide and broad, and may offend an enemie ſometime from one place, &amp; ſometime from an other, there needeth no ſuch thicknes. And being enforced at any part to reenforce the parapet, it may there with leſſe labour and anoyance be done, then vpon a Bulwarke. The ſuperficies of the rampier muſt bee ſo broad, that any peece may be vſed vpon it, and haue ſcope enough to recoyle. And the aſcent vnto it muſt lye ſo flat that the defenders may runne vp vpon it with eaſe, or plucke vp a peece of Artillerie by hand at any place of it, and therefore it muſt be free of incombraunces. Alſo the ſtreetes of the Fort muſt runne all direct from the Bulwarkes vnto the market place, and likewiſe from the middeſt of the Curtins. Which market place muſt bee large 300. foote ſquare, or little leſſe. The gate of the Fort muſt be placed in the middeſt of the Curtin, that from the Bulwarks on both ſides of it, it may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually defended, and muſt be ſet ſo lowe, that the defenders may go out and in to the couered waies, to defend the argin, or ſallie out, as little ſeene as may be. But the chiefeſt defence of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin muſt be through the priuie dores in the Cullion, paſſing the ſecrete ditch with a portable bridge, which may bee lightly layed and taken away, aſcending the Counterſcarpe: which Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarpe may be left ſomewhat flat, and pared ſteeper as need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth. The caſemate in the ditch (for not onely the firſt place in the flanke is called caſemate, but alſo any other edifice that may be made in the ditch to defend the ditch by) muſt be placed oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the exteriour angle of the Bulwarke, betwixt it and the ſecrete ditch, and muſt bee made full of holes of vſe Harquebuze and Muſket out at. And the walles of it muſt be ſo thinne, that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:10495:185"/>
being ruined, the ruine may make no great bodie in the ditch: and the way to man it, muſt be vnder ground, through the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, or by ſome other vault made for the purpoſe. The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered way round about the Fort muſt be ten foote broad, and the argin or banke ſo high that a man be not ſeene behind it: which may be ſixe or ſeauen foote, and againſt it there muſt be ſteppes made for the defenders to ſtand vpon to vſe their armes ouer it; and to mount vpon it, when it ſhall be needfull. The ſuperficies of the argin muſt be layd ſcarping, but in ſuch ſort that it may be ſcoured from the Fort, as in the figure following is ſeene. Here note, that as in a drie ground where an enemie may trench &amp; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer himſelf from the fort, an argin &amp; couered way, were thought neceſſarie, to giue him the more impeachment to approach the Counterſcarpe: ſo in a lowe waterie ground where an enemie cannot couer himſelfe, it were not good to make any argin at all: leaſt you giue him the meane to do the miſchiefe which, you would hinder him from doing.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is another maner of fortifying which is with earth: in which, in ſtead of a face of bricke or ſtone, is a face of turffe vſed, and for the Counterforts, faggots: which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of building is of little charge in reſpect of the other, and yet is much more durable againſt a forceable batterie. The experience thereof hath been ſufficiently ſeene in this late warres of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Low Countries; but it is not ſo durable againſt the wether: but being of good earth and the faggots greene, it wil the longer continue: and although the face waſt and moulder away with the wether, yet will the Fort continue defenceable. And the beſt is, the face may be repayred againe with little charge. With this manner of building were the townes in the Lowe countries reenforced, and alſo many ſmall Forts made both by the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> wherewith hée kept the townes beſieged: and alſo by the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotes,</hi> wherewith they frontiered the Duke, impeaching the courſes of his men: he pretending the aſſurance of his, through the Campe he had in the field to ſuccour them: and they for the moſt part, placing theirs ſo well watered and hard to bee kept from reliefe, hauing for the moſt part ſo commodious ſituations for the purpoſe: as ſome of them haue giuen their enemies tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell to get them, and others haue cauſed them to retire without the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as <hi>Lyllo</hi> &amp; others.

                     <p>The manner of the worke is this: the turffe muſt be cut like a wedge, of 12. or 14. inches long, and 5. or 6. inches broade equidiſtant, the one ende 4. or 5. inches thicke, and the other ſharpe, and theſe turffes would be taken in the beſt ground that lyeth néere about the Fort, and muſt be cut with a long ſharpe Spade, of fiue or ſixe inches broade, and 14. inches long, which muſt be well ſteeled, and kept very ſharpe: and the turffe muſt be caryed and handled without breaking, and layde in the worke, the great ende outward, and the graſſy ſide downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ſcarping, one in 5. or 6. foote, the rampire behinde the turffe riſing with the earth that is throwne out of the ditch, as faſt as the face of the worke riſeth.

And vpon the ſmall
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:10495:189"/>
ends of thoſe firſt layd faggots, muſt other faggots be layde, whoſe ſmall ends muſt ouerlappe the ſmall ends of the ſaid firſt faggots, ſome thrée foote and a halfe or thereabouts. And vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the great ends of theſe ſecond faggots, muſt a third faggot be layde, whoſe ſmall ends muſt likewiſe ouerlappe the great ends of the ſaid ſecond faggots, as the ſmall ende of the ſecond did the ſmall ends of the firſt, (and where wood is plentie, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing haſte to rayſe the worke, lay a fourth faggot in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,) which being done, rayſe againe the face of the worke fiue turffes higher, paring them by a lyne as is aforeſayde, and rayſing the earth behinde them as before, and then lay ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rowe of faggots, and thus continue the worke, vntill it ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſome twelue foote, aboue the foote it ſtandeth vppon; which foote muſt be left ſixe foote broade, vntill the Fort be full ended to receiue the earth which ſhall be throwne out of the bottome of the ditch, which from thence muſt be throwne into the Fort, and this foote muſt be afterward cut narrower flat off, but not ſo narrowe that it might put the rampire that ſtandeth vppon it in danger of falling. Which done, raiſe a parapet of ſome fiue or ſixe foote broade, more or leſſe, according to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Fort, and largeneſſe of the rampier, and make the ditch if it be where water aboundeth the broader, but ſtanding dry, the narrower and déeper. A great care muſt be had in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the ditch, of the goodneſſe of the ground, for feare of laying the worke vnder féete, to auoide which inconuenience, the beſt way is to leaue the wall a verie good foote, and not to ſinke the ditch too déepe on that ſide next it, but rather to make a ſecret ditch in the midſt, or to make that ſide next the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarpe very déepe, leauing the other ſide the ſhowler.
